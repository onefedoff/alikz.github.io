After the software teams successfully designed their systems, they pass their work onto an IT team. This IT team would then be responsible&nbsp;for&nbsp;fixing errors, taking calls, and maintaining and deploying the program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.indeed.com\/viewjob?jk=2cd47692d82bfb8b&amp;tk=1gmdvo10eln1c801&amp;from=serp&amp;vjs=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">site reliability engineer<\/a>&nbsp;is a position that Google created to streamline IT processes. This position is the bridge between IT operators and software developers, capitalizing upon the practices of DevOps. Where DevOps primarily focuses on ensuring that operation and developer teams work together to create reliable systems and develop products, SREs work to enhance system reliability and resilience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SREs primarily monitor the following aspects of a system:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Website Traffic<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>System Errors<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saturation\/Capacity<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>System Latency<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>System Automation<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Incident Response<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udc49 Read more about SRE principles and its benefits for organizations in <a href=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/blog\/sre\/\">our previous article<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Career and Salary \ud83d\udcb0<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The average salary of an SRE in the United States is around $100,000 a year. It is also common for SREs to earn bonuses that amount to a little over $20,000 extra a year. The more experience you gain as an SRE, the more money you will make.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers are more likely to hire candidates with a degree in computer science, though sufficient certifications and previous background in IT can guarantee you a position in a company. Some companies will allow you to work remotely, while others may require that you come into the office. Popular companies for SREs include Target, Twitter, Adobe, Wayfair, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Role and Responsibilities<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"968\" height=\"528\" src=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/SRE-meme-1.png\" alt=\"SRE meme\" class=\"wp-image-5549\" srcset=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/SRE-meme-1.png 968w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/SRE-meme-1-500x273.png 500w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/SRE-meme-1-320x175.png 320w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/SRE-meme-1-768x419.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 968px) 100vw, 968px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">SRE meme<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary responsibilities of an SRE (or SRE teams) include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing issues with a program\/system<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Quickly responding to client problems<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Creating software to streamline processes for IT workers<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Managing on-call responsibilities<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Documenting their knowledge of systems and common errors<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Automating&nbsp;system administration<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Analyzing&nbsp;past problems to prevent future errors<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>SREs&nbsp;constantly look for new ways to improve systems and reduce common errors or incidents. If such a malfunction occurs, an SRE must address the error quickly. Then, the SRE ought to reflect on how they can prevent such an error from occurring in the future by enhancing the reliability of that system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many site reliability engineers use AI programs to streamline their job.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/landing\/get-started-with-aiops\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Such programs<\/a>&nbsp;sort through system issues to determine which alerts are important.

You should learn how to program shell scripts as well as understand programming languages such as C, Rust, Go, Python, and Java.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also suggest that you learn how to create websites. To do so, either take a course or use cloud servers such as Amazon Web Services or Digital Ocean on your own time. Creating your website by coding your own HTML or using old-school programming methods such as PHP and MySQL can also help you become a better SRE.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning about automation through a continuous integration pipeline like Jenkins or Travis CI is also helpful. Furthermore, you should also know some basic code editing skills. Use programs such as Atom or Eclipse for coding practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must also have a basic understanding of NoSQL databases and data models. Understanding Linux and service-oriented architecture (SOA) is also quite helpful. We also recommend you understand monitoring tools and software systems (such as Acure).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though not all of these skills are necessary to become an SRE, they will help you succeed in your career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/133-1024x576.png\" alt=\"SRE courses picture\" class=\"wp-image-5565\" srcset=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/133-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/133-500x281.png 500w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/133-320x180.png 320w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/133-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/133-1536x864.png 1536w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/133-1200x675.png 1200w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/133-1568x882.png 1568w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/133.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Potential Online Courses<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel you have a sufficient background in coding, automation, programming languages, etc., reinforce your skills through online courses and other study materials.
