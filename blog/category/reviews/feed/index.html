<p>Network monitoring is a process when all networking components, including routers, switches, firewalls, servers, and virtual machines (VMs), are regularly reviewed and monitored for faults and performance. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Effective network monitoring should identify performance issues and bottleneck aids in the early detection of problems. Proactive monitoring can help avoid network downtime or failures.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Most Important Advantages Of Network Monitoring</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Complete Network Visibility</h3>



<p>Network monitoring provides managers with a<a href="https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/basics-of-network-monitoring.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> detailed overview of all the linked devices on a network</a>. It shows how data flows across them and allows to rapidly find and resolve critical incidents and prevent them in the future.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Improved Use of IT Resources</h3>



<p>Network monitoring systems&#8217; hardware and software technologies decrease manual effort for IT staff. This means that valued IT employees can dedicate more time to key organizational tasks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-14.png" alt="Network Monitoring" class="wp-image-3687" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-14.png 1920w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-14-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-14-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-14-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-14-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-14-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-14-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-14-1568x882.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Capacity To Detect Security Risks More Quickly</h3>



<p>Network monitoring assists companies in understanding what &#8220;typical&#8221; network performance looks like. As a result, when odd behavior happens, such as an inexplicable surge in network traffic levels, administrators may rapidly identify the problem‚Äîand evaluate whether it is serious.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Early Detection Of Future Infrastructure Requirements</h3>



<p>Network monitoring systems can generate information on how network components behaved over time. Network administrators can predict when the firm may need to consider updating or adopting new IT infrastructure by examining these reports.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who Is Responsible For Network Monitoring</h2>



<p>The network administrator is responsible for the proper functioning of the network infrastructure and must perform the following daily:</p>



<ul>
<li>Checking the health of servers, Internet connection, e-mail, other applications, as well as office equipment;</li>



<li>Side connection to servers;</li>



<li>Checking free space on hard drives, RAM and other capacities;</li>



<li>Verification of data backup implementation.</li>
</ul>



<p>The ongoing activity is aimed at the timely detection of errors in the operation of software and hardware, which minimizes the risk of critical problems.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="400" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Network-monitoring-meme.png" alt="Network Administrator Meme" class="wp-image-3748" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Network-monitoring-meme.png 750w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Network-monitoring-meme-500x267.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Network-monitoring-meme-320x171.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Network Administrator Meme</figcaption></figure>



<p>An alternative to a network administrator is automatic monitoring systems that can check workstations, servers, site availability, client and server applications and services, printers, scanners and other network equipment.</p>



<p>Network monitoring systems are indispensable assistants to network administrators. They allow not only collecting but also visualizing, structuring and sorting information about infrastructure components and events, as well as independently notifying administrators about incidents, reducing the time to eliminate them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Main Functions Of Network Monitoring Systems</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Discovering <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f50d.png" alt="üîç" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>



<p>Every network monitoring begins with the process of discovering. Obviously, you can&#8217;t monitor a network until you know what&#8217;s on it.</p>



<p>Network monitoring tools like Acure.io <strong>find every device on the network</strong>, including routers, switches, firewalls, servers, printers, and more. A network monitoring system automatically assigns the proper device role to each identified device when the discovery procedure is complete.</p>



<p>But discovering the components is only the start. You must understand the connections between the elements in order to monitor the network effectively. Because an issue with one device&#8217;s performance may affect another&#8217;s. </p>



<p>For instance, when a switch malfunctions, the whole network of devices attached to that switch cannot interact. If this is the switch linking the servers hosting an organization&#8217;s CRM system, there is a critical problem.</p>



<p>In the future, understanding the relationships between the components of the system will help to perform not only the<strong> root cause</strong> but also the <strong>impact analysis</strong>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Network Vizualization <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4ca.png" alt="üìä" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </h3>



<p>Their eyes are a network administrator&#8217;s most important diagnostic tool. They can save spending hours debugging network issues.</p>



<p>Network monitoring systems should provide <strong>network maps to assist network administrators in visualizing their networks</strong>. Network maps give users a clear and organized visual overview of the devices in a network, their connections, and the most recent status.</p>



<p>Some programs just offer a sketching tool, leaving network mapping to the administrator‚Äôs expertise. Other platforms, like Acure.io, can perform <strong>auto-discovering</strong> of all system elements and their connections and transform them into a full map in the form of topology. You can monitor the health of both the entire system and each configuration item separately and customize the map in a way that suits you the most.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="450" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Frame-9717-1.png" alt="Network Monitoring Meme" class="wp-image-3743" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Frame-9717-1.png 750w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Frame-9717-1-500x300.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Frame-9717-1-320x192.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Network Monitoring Meme</figcaption></figure>



<p>Proper visualization helps reduce incident resolution time. With auto-discovered relationships, you can quickly identify the root cause, saving time on troubleshooting rather than searching.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Constant Monitoring <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4bb.png" alt="üíª" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>



<p>Turn-key device responsibilities that specify what needs to be monitored are provided by network monitoring software. Device roles can be changed by network administrators, or new ones can be created entirely. Monitoring tools give network administrators access to a <strong>wide range of monitors</strong>. Network administrators should first keep an eye on <strong>CPU</strong>, <strong>memory</strong>, <strong>disk</strong> and <strong>interface usage</strong> as well as <strong>Ping availability</strong> and <strong>latency</strong>.</p>



<p>The majority of network monitoring software also tracks temperature in wire closets and other hardware elements like fans and power supply in switches. Additionally, they may keep an eye on network services like <strong>HTTP</strong>, <strong>TCP/IP</strong>, and <strong>FTP</strong>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Alerts and Notifications <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4e7.png" alt="üìß" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>



<p>Network administrators may respond to issues before they have an impact on users, apps, or the company. That‚Äôs why network monitoring systems should <strong>immediately alert network administrators when a problem occurs</strong>. They send out notifications by text, email, and logging.</p>



<p>CPU, memory, and interface usage are performance measures that change during the day. During times of peak usage, they may go beyond thresholds for a few seconds or minutes. Network administrators don&#8217;t want to deal with these small hiccups. Notifications from monitoring systems are set up with a time element to prevent this.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-1024x576.png" alt="IT Networks" class="wp-image-3732" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Network admins also need sleeping mode. But unfortunately, a lot of them should be ready for alerts they are stormed with 24/7. Some systems allow administrators to set blackout times during which notifications are disabled. Often alerts are duplicated, so many engineers do the same thing, which leads to additional time and money costs. To avoid storm alerts, <strong>monitoring systems use functions of noise reduction</strong>.  For example, Acure.io allows sorting events by priority and shows only important notifications.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">SLA Reports <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4c9.png" alt="üìâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>



<p>Network administrators are actively involved in the ongoing planning, analysis, and redesign of the network. The network monitoring systems <strong>offer both historical and real-time monitoring data to support this life cycle</strong>.</p>



<p>Network administrators can use this information to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Verify that network designs are producing the desired results</li>



<li>Show that SLA commitments are being met</li>



<li>Expose trends to deliver the performance required by users, applications, and the business</li>



<li>Rapidly identify and resolve performance issues</li>
</ul>



<p>Network monitoring programs are indispensable assistants for every system administrator. They allow you to quickly respond to anomalous activity within the local network, keep abreast of all network processes and, thus, automate some of the administrator&#8217;s routine activities: primarily those related to network security. Let&#8217;s take a look at which network monitoring programs are relevant in 2022.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Popular Network Monitoring Tools (2022)</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Zabbix</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.zabbix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zabbix</a> is a proper solution for networks and applications which uses a fascinating robust tool for monitoring and event correlation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="574" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zabbix-1024x574.png" alt="Zabbix Network Monitoring Tool Interface" class="wp-image-2708" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zabbix-1024x574.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zabbix-500x280.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zabbix-320x179.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zabbix-768x430.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zabbix-1536x861.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zabbix-1200x672.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zabbix-1568x879.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zabbix-1080x605.png 1080w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zabbix.png 1904w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Zabbix allows you to <strong>customize your dashboards and web interface </strong>to focus on the most important network components. <strong>Notifications and problem escalations</strong> can be based on custom actions that are applied to hosts or groups of hosts. Actions can even be configured to run remote commands, so some script of yours can run on a controlled host if certain event criteria are observed.</p>



<p><strong>The program graphs </strong>shows data such as network bandwidth and CPU usage and collects it for custom display systems. In addition, Zabbix supports customizable maps, screens, and even slideshows showing the current status of monitored devices.</p>



<p>Basically, Zabbix works with <strong>software agents</strong> running on monitored systems. But this solution can also work without agents, using the SNMP protocol or other monitoring capabilities. Zabbix supports VMware and other virtualization hypervisors by providing detailed hypervisor performance and activity data. Particular attention is also paid to the monitoring of Java application servers, web services and databases.</p>



<p><strong>Hosts </strong>can be added manually or through an automatic discovery process. A wide range of default templates apply to the most common use cases such as Linux, FreeBSD and Windows servers; widely used services such as SMTP and HTTP as well as ICMP and IPMI for detailed network hardware monitoring. In addition, custom checks written in Perl, Python or almost any other language can be integrated into Zabbix.</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4b0.png" alt="üí∞" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Zabbix is <strong>free </strong>since it was released under the GPL license. There are no limitations on the number of monitored devices, you can use Zabbix to monitor many thousands of devices absolutely free.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Acure</h3>



<p><a href="https://acure.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acure is a newly released cloud-based AIOps observability and automation patform</a> that offers a single, interactive ecosystem for monitoring and resolving common cases encountered by modern IT environments.</p>



<p>Acure has a simple and user-fiendly interface that allows the creation of a  workspace in seconds. You can also <strong>connect it to popular IT monitoring systems</strong>, such as Zabbix or Prometheus, using <strong>templates </strong>or manually, <strong>add data from virtualization systems</strong>, such as VMware, add Azure or AWS cloud providers, collect raw logs from your services.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="480" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Service-Mode-in-Acure-1024x480.jpg" alt="Acure Network Monitoring Tool Interface" class="wp-image-3480" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Service-Mode-in-Acure-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Service-Mode-in-Acure-500x235.jpg 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Service-Mode-in-Acure-320x150.jpg 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Service-Mode-in-Acure-768x360.jpg 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Service-Mode-in-Acure.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As it was mentioned in examples before, Acure <strong>automatically discovers</strong> configuration items and connections between them to place them on automatic monitoring. IT infrastructure is visualized as a <strong>topology graph </strong>which shows connections, subordinations and the health of configurations units. IT allows you to quickly and efficiently perform root cause and impact analysis.</p>



<p>Acure automates not only discovering but also r<strong>ules and actions</strong>. You can create scripts and use automation to make changes smoothly to the whole system without extra efforts. The <strong>Plugins system</strong> allows the administrator to create and add automated <strong>notification methods</strong> via e-mail, sms or popular messengers.</p>



<p>Acure also <strong>has automated testing feature </strong>to set up checks that can imitate user actions and report any anomalies as they run, even when infrastructure monitoring does not signal a problem.</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4b0.png" alt="üí∞" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Pricing of this software is $0 </strong>which offers: unlimited events, unlimited users, unlimited automation rules, up to 5GB of daily incoming data and up to 100 tests daily.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Nagios</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.nagios.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nagios</a> is an established network monitoring software system that has been in active development for many years. It can be difficult for beginners, but the rather complex configuration is also an advantage of this tool, as it can be adapted to almost any monitoring task.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="669" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nagios-interface.png" alt="Nagios Network Monitoring Tool Interface" class="wp-image-3720" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nagios-interface.png 1000w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nagios-interface-500x335.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nagios-interface-320x214.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nagios-interface-768x514.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>Nagios monitors all mission-critical infrastructure components, including applications, services, operating systems, network protocols, system metrics, and network infrastructure. Multiple APIs allow for <strong>easy interaction</strong> with both internal and external applications.</p>



<p>The platform offers a custom email, SMS and instant messaging<strong> notification mechanism</strong> for most popular messengers.</p>



<p>In addition, the display feature shows all monitored devices in a <strong>logical, color-coded representation</strong> of their location on the network, allowing problems to be shown as they occur.</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4b0.png" alt="üí∞" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Nagios is completely <strong>free</strong>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Icinga</h3>



<p><a href="https://icinga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Icinga</a> started as a branch of the Nagios monitoring system, but has recently been rewritten into a standalone solution known as Icinga 2. However, Icinga 1 is compatible with a large number of Nagios plugins and configuration. Icinga 2 was designed to be less bulky, performance-oriented, and more user-friendly. It offers a modular architecture and multi-threaded design that neither Nagios nor Icinga 1 has.</p>



<p>There are several variations of the web interface for Icinga, but the main difference between this monitoring software solution and Nagios is the configuration that can be done through the web interface rather than through configuration files.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-1024x576.png" alt="Icinga Network Monitoring Tool Interface" class="wp-image-3721" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Icinga <strong>integrates with a variety of monitoring and graphical display software packages </strong>such as PNP4Nagios, inGraph and Graphite to provide a robust visualization of your network. In addition, Icinga has <strong>advanced reporting capabilities</strong>.</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4b0.png" alt="üí∞" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Also <strong>free </strong>like Nagios. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Datadog Network Monitoring</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Datadog Network Monitoring</a> helps to monitor the performance of network devices.The technology, which is <strong>cloud-based</strong>, can scan a network to find every connected device. The network monitor will compile an asset list and <strong>a network topology diagram</strong> using the data from this study. By using this method, the system runs its own setup processes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Log Monitoring?</h2>



<p>Collecting logs for future observation is called <strong><a href="https://acure.io/blog/log-monitoring/">log monitoring</a></strong>. It is the process of categorizing logs and searching for abnormalities that might cause system problems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Steps of Logs Processing</h3>



<p>In the processing logs, at least four stages can be distinguished:</p>



<p>1. <strong><a href="https://acure.io/integrations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collecting logs</a></strong> from servers and containers using agents and sending them via network protocols to a centralized repository either directly or through aggregators with pre-processing;</p>



<p>2. <strong>Log messages</strong> are parsed inside the aggregators, enriched with additional information (time stamp, source ID, location tag, etc.), converted to a single format and sent to storage ‚Äã‚Äãready for indexing;</p>



<p>3. Direct storage of logs and storage <strong>management</strong>;</p>



<p>4. <strong>Analysis and visualization of data</strong> obtained from logs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="400" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Log-Monitoring-Meme.jpg" alt="Logs Meme" class="wp-image-3634" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Log-Monitoring-Meme.jpg 750w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Log-Monitoring-Meme-500x267.jpg 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Log-Monitoring-Meme-320x171.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Logs Meme</figcaption></figure>

<p>There are about a hundred software solutions on the market with the required propensity to collect and analyze logs. In this article, we will look at 4 popular FREE log monitoring tools and compare their functionality as aggregators, a storage system and instruments of visualization.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>ELK Stack</strong></li>



<li><strong>Graylog Open</strong></li>



<li><strong>Acure</strong></li>



<li><strong>Grafana Loki</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. ElasticSearch + Logstash + Kibana</h3>



<p>ElasticSearch, Logstash and Kibana were originally developed as open source products and developed separately from each other, but in 2015 they merged under the <a href="http://elastic.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Elastic brand </a>and began to be a single product &#8211; the ELK stack.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="702" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1024x702.png" alt="ELK Stack Monitoring Tool" class="wp-image-3474" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1024x702.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-500x343.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-320x219.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-768x527.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1200x823.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">ELK Stack Monitoring Tool</figcaption></figure>



<p>Logstash is a server-side data processing pipeline that simultaneously receives data from multiple sources, transforms it, and then sends the processed data to Elasticsearch storage. The main functionality of <strong>Logstash as a log aggregator</strong> is the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>The ability to accept data in different formats and different sizes from many sources using all sorts of input plugins;</li>



<li>Processing of input data using separate plugins;</li>



<li>Output plugins are used to send processed structured logs to various data storage systems (most often Elasticsearch), message brokers (kafka, redis), etc.</li>



<li>Logstash has the ability to use different codecs to decode and encode input and output data: the main ones are plain for working with Plain text messages and<strong> JSON</strong> for working with events in JSON format.</li>



<li>The processing pipeline configuration is set in a simple text file.</li>
</ul>



<p>The centerpiece of the ELK stack is <strong>Elasticsearch</strong>, a high-performance full-text search engine based on the<strong> Apache Lucene open-source library</strong>. It combines the functions of a database, as well as a search and analytics engine, with the following main features:</p>



<ul>
<li>Elasticsearch is non-relational document-oriented data storage (NoSQL) in JSON format without strict structure;</li>



<li>All work with the database is based on JSON requests using the REST API, which allows you to add, view, modify and delete data, issue documents by index, calculate various statistics;</li>



<li>The absence of a schema allows you to upload any text documents to the storage and index them automatically;</li>



<li>The indexing procedure consists in processing the text of the document by the analyzer and adding the output set of tokens to the search index;</li>



<li>Elasticsearch provides fast and flexible full-text search across all fields in all data warehouse documents (words from a query are searched by index);</li>



<li>Support of several different fuzzy search methods,</li>



<li>Work with texts of oriental languages CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) is supported;</li>



<li>Elasticsearch has high scale-out and replication capabilities for high-load projects with large volumes of data, as well as relatively easy management and good fault tolerance.</li>
</ul>



<p>Kibana, as part of the ELK stack, is the tool responsible for presenting search query results to Elasticsearch in a human-readable form. In essence, <strong>Kibana is a web interface for searching, viewing and interacting with documents in the data warehouse</strong>, allowing you to:</p>



<ul>
<li>send search queries to Elasticsearch (using special KQL syntax, Kibana Query Language) and carry out all kinds of filtering of the results obtained,</li>



<li>analyze data and visualize the results in the form of various charts, histograms, tables, graphs, maps, etc.,</li>



<li>create, modify, save and load custom dashboards that combine several visualizations on one screen, and third-party dashboards can also be loaded,</li>



<li>administrate Elasticsearch data warehouse, manage indexes and processing pipelines,</li>



<li>manage the rights and levels of user access to different elements of the system.</li>
</ul>



<p>It should be noted that in the latest versions (starting from 7.14) Elastic actually switched to collecting logs using their own agent programs (Elastic Agents) installed on servers and containers instead of using input plugins for Logstash. </p>



<p>Elastic Agent is a single, unified way to add monitoring of logs, metrics, and other types of data per node, making it easier and faster to deploy monitoring in a large system. </p>



<p>The Kibana web interface has an additional Fleet panel that can be used to add and manage agents, and you can also install ready-made integrations for popular services and platforms from it. The integrations provide a fairly simple and fast way to connect standard data sources, plus they come with customized elements such as dashboards, visualizations, and pipelines for extracting structured fields from log messages.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Graylog Open</h3>



<p>One of the systems competing with the ELK stack for collecting and processing logs is <a href="https://www.graylog.org/products/open-source" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Graylog Open</a>, which also uses Elasticsearch as a log storage and search engine. Graylog itself directly performs the functions of a log aggregator and visualization tool in the form of a client single-page browser application.</p>



<p>In terms of log aggregation, the Graylog functionality is very similar to the Logstash functionality:</p>



<ul>
<li>the ability to receive data in different formats from various sources using various input plugins,</li>



<li>processing input data using so-called extractors, in which the rules for extracting the values of the desired named fields from message strings can be specified using regular expressions and grok patterns,</li>



<li>sending processed structured logs to the Elasticsearch data storage system or, using special output plugins, to other systems,</li>



<li>the ability to work with both simple text messages and events in JSON format .</li>
</ul>



<p>Since Graylog uses Elasticsearch, it is similar to the ELK stack in terms of search queries and working with the data warehouse and index, and in terms of processing and visualizing data from log messages, the Graylog web interface provides functionality that is similar to Kibana.</p>



<p>Despite the significant similarity in the principles of operation and user functions between the ELK stack and Graylog, the latter has a number of features:</p>



<ul>
<li>additional mongoDB database to store configurations and settings,</li>



<li>ability to create and combine multiple search queries into one action and view the results on a dashboard screen.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="620" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1-1024x620.png" alt="Graylog Log Monitoring Tool Interface" class="wp-image-3475" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1-1024x620.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1-500x303.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1-320x194.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1-768x465.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1-1536x930.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1.png 2048w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1-1200x727.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1-1568x949.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Graylog Log Monitoring Tool Interface</figcaption></figure>



<p>But the most important difference and advantage of Graylog Open over the ELK stack is the presence of a built-in notification system (alerts) in case of any specific situations or events in the process of collecting logs (there is a notification system in ELK, but it is paid, although there are also free third-party plugins with similar functionality). </p>



<p><strong>Graylog Alerts are periodically self-triggered search queries that can send notifications if certain conditions are met as a result of the query.</strong> Graylog allows you to set a variety of alert conditions based on the data it collects, the following are available by default (for others, you need to install plugins):</p>



<ul>
<li>the filter condition is triggered when at least one message arrives in the specified stream, in which a specific field contains the specified value,</li>



<li>the aggregation condition is triggered when the result of the aggregation (usually a counter of the values of some fields) exceeds a certain threshold value.</li>
</ul>



<p>Notifications can be sent via email or http to any configured recipient.</p>



<p>Graylog, as well as the latest versions of Elastic, provides the ability to install its agents on each controlled system (Graylog Collector Sidecars), which collect the necessary information and send it to the server. </p>



<p>Using a separate Graylog panel Sidecars in the web interface, you can centrally manage and maintain a consistent configuration of various logging agents on all nodes. For this, a system of tags is used, which are created through the web console and contain configurations for collecting a certain type of logs (for example, Apache logs, DNS logs, etc.), and Sidecar agents on specific machines can ‚Äúself-configure‚Äù by the specified tag and start sending data.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Acure</h3>



<p><strong><a href="https://acure.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acure platform is a freemium solution for log monitoring and AIOps</a></strong>. There are no restrictions on the number of users, events or automation rules and up to 5 GB of daily incoming data. Although Acure is still a very young product, in terms of functionality it can compete with well-established log monitoring tools like the ELK stack, since it has all the necessary elements to organize a data collection and processing system.</p>



<p>As a log message aggregator, Acure can perform the following functions:</p>



<ul>
<li>receiving data in JSON format from various sources via http and many connection templates (Zabbix , Prometheus , Nagios, Ntopng , SCOM, etc.);</li>



<li>its own low-code engine for processing of input data: extracting named field values from message text using regular expressions, transformation and change of field values, adding new fields and their values (enriching data with new labels);</li>



<li>storage of logs in ClickHouse database;</li>



<li>management of user access rights to configurations and settings of data flows.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="482" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Acure-logs-1024x482.jpg" alt="Events &amp; Logs in Acure" class="wp-image-3479" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Acure-logs-1024x482.jpg 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Acure-logs-500x236.jpg 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Acure-logs-320x151.jpg 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Acure-logs-768x362.jpg 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Acure-logs.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Events &amp; Logs in Acure</figcaption></figure>



<p>Acure uses the ClickHouse DBMS as a data store, as well as search and analytical engines, which gives it the following functionality:</p>



<ul>
<li>sending search queries (with a syntax similar to Lucene) and all kinds of filtering of the results,</li>



<li>column type of the ClickHouse database provides very fast processing of search and analytical queries (lack of indexing),</li>



<li>the model for the database is generated automatically based on the JSON model of a particular stream, the necessary fields are added if it‚Äôs required.</li>
</ul>



<p>In terms of data visualization, Acure has the following functionality:</p>



<ul>
<li>displaying the total number of processed events as a time series histogram;</li>



<li>representation of the values of various fields in the form of a histogram of frequency (for numeric fields, the minimum, maximum and average value are also calculated);</li>



<li>support for Markdown markup in displaying the text of log messages (you can write your own handler that will add Markdown markup to the required fields);</li>



<li>visual filter constructor with the ability to include and exclude specific field values in the filter by clicking on them.</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition to the standard presentation of raw log and event data, there are also more specific visual components:</p>

<p>Acure also has a notification system that works on the same principles as Graylog or Splunk, there is a synthetic trigger mechanism for generating events, and a ‚ÄúRules and Actions‚Äù mechanism for triggering the necessary actions to trigger complex rules.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Grafana Loki</h3>



<p>Grafana Loki is a relatively recent addition to the list of log monitoring tools and analysis software solutions &#8211; the project was launched in 2018. <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/loki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grafana Loki&nbsp;</a>works in the same way as the ELK stack and Graylog, but with its own specifics.</p>



<p>Loki itself is nothing more than an indexer of the structured logs it receives and indexing is not carried out according to the entire text of log messages, only according to log metadata (tags or labels), while the logs themselves are compressed side by side into separate files and stored either locally, or in cloud storage like Amazon S3 or GCS. Full-text search by index is not possible in Loki. </p>



<p>The data is searched first by indexed fields and then the text of the selected logs is scanned with regular expressions. This approach avoids problems with RAM requirements (a full-text index of logs is often comparable in size to the logs themselves, and for a quick search it must be loaded into memory), but it significantly increases the search time in case of a large volume of logs. </p>



<p>To speed up the search, Loki can split the request into several parts and execute them in parallel, so that the processing speed depends on the allocated resources.</p>



<p>Secondly, Loki delegates all the main work (parsing, finding named fields in the text of log messages, their transformation and reduction to a common format) to collector agents. <strong>Loki &#8216;s native agent is Promtail, although it is possible to use Fluentd, Logstash and some others. </strong></p>



<p>Currently, Promtail can only read log messages from local files and from the systemd service, but it borrows Prometheus &#8216;s service discovery mechanism, which allows it to automatically integrate with Kubernetes and collect logs from nodes, services, or pods, immediately putting tags on based on metadata from Kubernetes . </p>



<p>The mechanism for processing log messages and bringing them to a structured form in Promtail is similar to the mechanism of extractors in Graylog (although there are some nuances everywhere), but Promtail does not have a graphical interface and the entire configuration of processing pipelines must be specified separately in a text file, which is not always convenient.</p>



<p>A tool for visualizing data from logs in the Grafana system Loki performs, of course, Grafana . Search queries in Loki can be sent in a special Grafana interface Explore, queries use LogQL very similar to Prometheus PromQL . Like Kibana, Grafana provides a wide range of data visualization options:</p>



<ul>
<li>search query results can be displayed in the form of various graphs, histograms, tables, heat maps, etc.,</li>



<li>it is possible to combine several visualizations on one dashboard, which can be saved, loaded and modified, as well as exported and imported from Grafana.com.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="516" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2-1024x516.png" alt="Grafana Loki Log Monitoring Tool Interface" class="wp-image-3481" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2-1024x516.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2-500x252.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2-320x161.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2-768x387.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2-1536x774.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2-1200x605.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2-1568x790.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Grafana Loki Log Monitoring Tool Interface</figcaption></figure>



<p>Grafana has a highly developed built-in alert system, which, similar to Graylog, are periodically self- launched search queries that generate notifications when certain conditions are met. At the same time, the options for configuring and setting up alerts provided in the Grafana graphical interface are very wide, and notifications can be sent through many channels: email, slack, telegram, discord, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Instead of a conclusion&#8230;</h2>



<p>For all the considered log monitoring tools in the latest versions, it should be noted a strong trend towards delegating the functionality of the primary processing of logs to their local agents, which can lead to some simplification of the functionality of log aggregators. It is also worth noting the trend of a gradual reduction in free functionality and the emergence of more and more paid ones. </p>



<p>This applies to ELK and Graylog. <strong>ELK</strong> stack is one of the most complete log monitoring tools for collecting and processing data but alerting only in paid versions significantly spoils the picture. <strong>Graylog</strong> is also more of a log analysis tool. <strong>Grafana Loki</strong> is one of the simplest and lightest log monitoring tools, and it is suitable for solving narrow problems when full observability of systems and services is not needed. </p>



<p><strong>Acure</strong>, despite being a young platform, is significantly superior in functionality to the presented log monitoring tools and provides full observability and powerful functionality absolutely for free.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="650" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AIOps-Inforgraphics-Acuce.io_.jpg" alt="What is AIOps?" class="wp-image-3678" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AIOps-Inforgraphics-Acuce.io_.jpg 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AIOps-Inforgraphics-Acuce.io_-500x271.jpg 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AIOps-Inforgraphics-Acuce.io_-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AIOps-Inforgraphics-Acuce.io_-320x173.jpg 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AIOps-Inforgraphics-Acuce.io_-768x416.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">What is AIOps?</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is an AIOps Platform?</h2>



<p><strong>AIOps platforms use artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to automate and improve IT operations</strong>. The goal of an AIOps platform is to streamline IT operations, reduce downtime, and proactively identify and resolve IT incidents before they impact end-users.</p>



<p>A typical AIOps platform integrates <strong>multiple data sources</strong>, such as log files, performance metrics, network traffic data, and other data sources, to build <strong>a comprehensive view of IT infrastructure and application performance</strong>. The platform then uses AI and machine learning algorithms to analyze this data and identify patterns, anomalies, and potential problems.</p>



<p>The platform can also <strong>automate IT operations tasks </strong>such as incident management, problem management, and change management. By automating these tasks, an AIOps platform can reduce the amount of manual work required by IT teams, improve incident response times, and reduce the risk of human error.</p>



<p>AIOps platforms are typically used by large enterprises that have complex IT infrastructures, but they are becoming more common as more organizations adopt digital technologies and seek to improve their IT operations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here Is How It Works:</h2>



<p>To fully automate and monitor IT processes, AIOps uses five different types of algorithms. The algorithms are as follows:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Data Selection</h4>



<p>AIOps initially filters away up to 99% of the data to find the problematic ones because enormous amounts of redundant data are collected and stored.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Pattern Discovery</h4>



<p>For more sophisticated analytics, use correlation to organize the selected, significant data items and discover links between them.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. <a href="https://acure.io/use-cases/root-cause-impact-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Root Cause Analysis</a></h4>



<p>The initial sources of the problems are uncovered in this step. RCA helps not only to detect a problem, but also shows its cause, that helps to prevent its occurrence in the future.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. <a href="https://acure.io/features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collaboration</a></h4>



<p>The relevant IT teams are brought together to discuss remedial actions when the underlying causes of the problems have been determined. Data on the incidents are also preserved to help with future problem diagnostics.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. <a href="https://acure.io/use-cases/single-system-for-automated-it-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automation</a></h4>



<p>Automating response and correction as much as feasible improves the accuracy and speed of solutions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why AIOps is a Future? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="üöÄ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="400" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AIOps-Meme-Acure.io_.jpg" alt="AIOps Meme" class="wp-image-3671" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AIOps-Meme-Acure.io_.jpg 750w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AIOps-Meme-Acure.io_-500x267.jpg 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AIOps-Meme-Acure.io_-320x171.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p>AIOps gathers and examines data to make sophisticated automated judgments. This data is used to forecast potential future events that could impact performance and availability before they happen. AIOps accelerate problem solving and deployment.</p>



<p>AIOps adoption is skyrocketing, which is a reflection of a pragmatic change that is transforming IT operations.</p>



<p>Businesses can benefit from the following by implementing AIOps:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Improved Collaboration</strong></h3>



<p>Within IT groups and between IT and other business divisions, AIOps enhance collaboration and workflow processes. Teams may immediately comprehend their responsibilities and requirements using customizable reports and dashboards.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Improved Business ROI IT Productivity</strong></h3>



<p>Businesses benefit from a reduction in the mean time to repair, outages prevented through issue prediction, and automation of repetitive manual processes‚ÄîAIOps aid in maximizing your team&#8217;s overall capacity while lowering costs and increasing output.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital Transformation Success</strong></h3>



<p>AIOps delivers commercial value for firms adopting a digital-centric strategy by reducing time and effort so your employees can concentrate on innovation instead. AIOps provides end-to-end visibility into the infrastructure and apps.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Improved Performance Monitoring and Service Delivery</strong></h3>



<p>AIOps anticipates resource usage and performance problems. By using probable cause analytics, it concentrates on the most likely cause of an issue‚Äîclustering and anomaly detection aid in locating the underlying problems that cause events.</p>



<p>By offering a technology foundation for managing the machine learning lifecycle through automation and scalability, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) enables enterprises to ease many problems on the way to AI with ROI.</p>



<p>Data scientists and operations specialists can work together and communicate using MLOps, a set of techniques. Implementing Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in expansive production environments can be automated while also improving quality and streamlining the management process. Aligning models with both business demands and regulatory standards is simpler.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top 20 AIOps Tools &amp; Platforms&nbsp;(2022)</h2>
