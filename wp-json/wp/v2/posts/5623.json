This can be done through monitoring tools, user reports, or other means.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Incident classification:<\/strong> Once an incident has been identified, it is classified based on its severity and impact on the organization. This helps prioritize the incident and determine the appropriate level of response.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Incident resolution:<\/strong> After an incident has been classified, it is passed to the appropriate team or individual for resolution. This may involve troubleshooting, repairs, or other actions to restore regular service.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Incident closure:<\/strong> Once an incident has been resolved, it is marked as closed, and any necessary <a href=\"https:\/\/www.atlassian.com\/incident-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">incident documentation<\/a> is completed.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Is IT Incident Management Important?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Effective IT incident management is critical for minimizing the impact of IT incidents on an organization. When an IT incident occurs, it can cause disruptions to business operations and lead to lost productivity, customer dissatisfaction, and financial losses. By addressing incidents quickly and efficiently, organizations can minimize these negative impacts and ensure that their IT services run smoothly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, IT incident management helps organizations improve their overall IT service delivery. By tracking and analyzing incident data, organizations can identify patterns and trends and make changes to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
