The main functionality of <strong>Logstash as a log aggregator<\/strong> is the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to accept data in different formats and different sizes from many sources using all sorts of input plugins;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Processing of input data using separate plugins;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Output plugins are used to send processed structured logs to various data storage systems (most often Elasticsearch), message brokers (kafka, redis), etc.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Logstash has the ability to use different codecs to decode and encode input and output data: the main ones are plain for working with Plain text messages and<strong> JSON<\/strong> for working with events in JSON format.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The processing pipeline configuration is set in a simple text file.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The centerpiece of the ELK stack is <strong>Elasticsearch<\/strong>, a high-performance full-text search engine based on the<strong> Apache Lucene open-source library<\/strong>. It combines the functions of a database, as well as a search and analytics engine, with the following main features:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Elasticsearch is non-relational document-oriented data storage (NoSQL) in JSON format without strict structure;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>All work with the database is based on JSON requests using the REST API, which allows you to add, view, modify and delete data, issue documents by index, calculate various statistics;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The absence of a schema allows you to upload any text documents to the storage and index them automatically;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The indexing procedure consists in processing the text of the document by the analyzer and adding the output set of tokens to the search index;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Elasticsearch provides fast and flexible full-text search across all fields in all data warehouse documents (words from a query are searched by index);<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Support of several different fuzzy search methods,<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Work with texts of oriental languages CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) is supported;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Elasticsearch has high scale-out and replication capabilities for high-load projects with large volumes of data, as well as relatively easy management and good fault tolerance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Kibana, as part of the ELK stack, is the tool responsible for presenting search query results to Elasticsearch in a human-readable form. In essence, <strong>Kibana is a web interface for searching, viewing and interacting with documents in the data warehouse<\/strong>, allowing you to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>send search queries to Elasticsearch (using special KQL syntax, Kibana Query Language) and carry out all kinds of filtering of the results obtained,<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>analyze data and visualize the results in the form of various charts, histograms, tables, graphs, maps, etc.,<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>create, modify, save and load custom dashboards that combine several visualizations on one screen, and third-party dashboards can also be loaded,<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>administrate Elasticsearch data warehouse, manage indexes and processing pipelines,<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>manage the rights and levels of user access to different elements of the system.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It should be noted that in the latest versions (starting from 7.14) Elastic actually switched to collecting logs using their own agent programs (Elastic Agents) installed on servers and containers instead of using input plugins for Logstash. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elastic Agent is a single, unified way to add monitoring of logs, metrics, and other types of data per node, making it easier and faster to deploy monitoring in a large system. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kibana web interface has an additional Fleet panel that can be used to add and manage agents, and you can also install ready-made integrations for popular services and platforms from it. The integrations provide a fairly simple and fast way to connect standard data sources, plus they come with customized elements such as dashboards, visualizations, and pipelines for extracting structured fields from log messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Graylog Open<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the systems competing with the ELK stack for collecting and processing logs is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.graylog.org\/products\/open-source\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Graylog Open<\/a>, which also uses Elasticsearch as a log storage and search engine. Graylog itself directly performs the functions of a log aggregator and visualization tool in the form of a client single-page browser application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of log aggregation, the Graylog functionality is very similar to the Logstash functionality:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>the ability to receive data in different formats from various sources using various input plugins,<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>processing input data using so-called extractors, in which the rules for extracting the values of the desired named fields from message strings can be specified using regular expressions and grok patterns,<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>sending processed structured logs to the Elasticsearch data storage system or, using special output plugins, to other systems,<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>the ability to work with both simple text messages and events in JSON format .<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Graylog uses Elasticsearch, it is similar to the ELK stack in terms of search queries and working with the data warehouse and index, and in terms of processing and visualizing data from log messages, the Graylog web interface provides functionality that is similar to Kibana.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the significant similarity in the principles of operation and user functions between the ELK stack and Graylog, the latter has a number of features:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>additional mongoDB database to store configurations and settings,<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>ability to create and combine multiple search queries into one action and view the results on a dashboard screen.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"620\" src=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-1-1024x620.png\" alt=\"Graylog Log Monitoring Tool Interface\" class=\"wp-image-3475\" srcset=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-1-1024x620.png 1024w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-1-500x303.png 500w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-1-320x194.png 320w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-1-768x465.png 768w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-1-1536x930.png 1536w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-1.png 2048w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-1-1200x727.png 1200w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-1-1568x949.png 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Graylog Log Monitoring Tool Interface<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But the most important difference and advantage of Graylog Open over the ELK stack is the presence of a built-in notification system (alerts) in case of any specific situations or events in the process of collecting logs (there is a notification system in ELK, but it is paid, although there are also free third-party plugins with similar functionality). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Graylog Alerts are periodically self-triggered search queries that can send notifications if certain conditions are met as a result of the query.<\/strong> Graylog allows you to set a variety of alert conditions based on the data it collects, the following are available by default (for others, you need to install plugins):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>the filter condition is triggered when at least one message arrives in the specified stream, in which a specific field contains the specified value,<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>the aggregation condition is triggered when the result of the aggregation (usually a counter of the values of some fields) exceeds a certain threshold value.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Notifications can be sent via email or http to any configured recipient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graylog, as well as the latest versions of Elastic, provides the ability to install its agents on each controlled system (Graylog Collector Sidecars), which collect the necessary information and send it to the server. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a separate Graylog panel Sidecars in the web interface, you can centrally manage and maintain a consistent configuration of various logging agents on all nodes. For this, a system of tags is used, which are created through the web console and contain configurations for collecting a certain type of logs (for example, Apache logs, DNS logs, etc.), and Sidecar agents on specific machines can \u201cself-configure\u201d by the specified tag and start sending data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Acure<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Acure platform is a freemium solution for log monitoring and AIOps<\/a><\/strong>.

Grafana Loki<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Grafana Loki is a relatively recent addition to the list of log monitoring tools and analysis software solutions &#8211; the project was launched in 2018. <a href=\"https:\/\/grafana.com\/oss\/loki\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Grafana Loki&nbsp;<\/a>works in the same way as the ELK stack and Graylog, but with its own specifics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Loki itself is nothing more than an indexer of the structured logs it receives and indexing is not carried out according to the entire text of log messages, only according to log metadata (tags or labels), while the logs themselves are compressed side by side into separate files and stored either locally, or in cloud storage like Amazon S3 or GCS. Full-text search by index is not possible in Loki. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data is searched first by indexed fields and then the text of the selected logs is scanned with regular expressions. This approach avoids problems with RAM requirements (a full-text index of logs is often comparable in size to the logs themselves, and for a quick search it must be loaded into memory), but it significantly increases the search time in case of a large volume of logs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To speed up the search, Loki can split the request into several parts and execute them in parallel, so that the processing speed depends on the allocated resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, Loki delegates all the main work (parsing, finding named fields in the text of log messages, their transformation and reduction to a common format) to collector agents. <strong>Loki &#8216;s native agent is Promtail, although it is possible to use Fluentd, Logstash and some others. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Promtail can only read log messages from local files and from the systemd service, but it borrows Prometheus &#8216;s service discovery mechanism, which allows it to automatically integrate with Kubernetes and collect logs from nodes, services, or pods, immediately putting tags on based on metadata from Kubernetes . <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mechanism for processing log messages and bringing them to a structured form in Promtail is similar to the mechanism of extractors in Graylog (although there are some nuances everywhere), but Promtail does not have a graphical interface and the entire configuration of processing pipelines must be specified separately in a text file, which is not always convenient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A tool for visualizing data from logs in the Grafana system Loki performs, of course, Grafana . Search queries in Loki can be sent in a special Grafana interface Explore, queries use LogQL very similar to Prometheus PromQL . Like Kibana, Grafana provides a wide range of data visualization options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>search query results can be displayed in the form of various graphs, histograms, tables, heat maps, etc.,<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>it is possible to combine several visualizations on one dashboard, which can be saved, loaded and modified, as well as exported and imported from Grafana.com.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"516\" src=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-2-1024x516.png\" alt=\"Grafana Loki Log Monitoring Tool Interface\" class=\"wp-image-3481\" srcset=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-2-1024x516.png 1024w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-2-500x252.png 500w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-2-320x161.png 320w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-2-768x387.png 768w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-2-1536x774.png 1536w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-2-1200x605.png 1200w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-2-1568x790.png 1568w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/image-2.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Grafana Loki Log Monitoring Tool Interface<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Grafana has a highly developed built-in alert system, which, similar to Graylog, are periodically self- launched search queries that generate notifications when certain conditions are met.
