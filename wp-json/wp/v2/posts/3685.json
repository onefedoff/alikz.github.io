They allow not only collecting but also visualizing, structuring and sorting information about infrastructure components and events, as well as independently notifying administrators about incidents, reducing the time to eliminate them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Main Functions Of Network Monitoring Systems<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Discovering \ud83d\udd0d<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every network monitoring begins with the process of discovering. Obviously, you can&#8217;t monitor a network until you know what&#8217;s on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Network monitoring tools like Acure.io <strong>find every device on the network<\/strong>, including routers, switches, firewalls, servers, printers, and more. A network monitoring system automatically assigns the proper device role to each identified device when the discovery procedure is complete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But discovering the components is only the start. You must understand the connections between the elements in order to monitor the network effectively. Because an issue with one device&#8217;s performance may affect another&#8217;s. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, when a switch malfunctions, the whole network of devices attached to that switch cannot interact. If this is the switch linking the servers hosting an organization&#8217;s CRM system, there is a critical problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, understanding the relationships between the components of the system will help to perform not only the<strong> root cause<\/strong> but also the <strong>impact analysis<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Network Vizualization \ud83d\udcca <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Their eyes are a network administrator&#8217;s most important diagnostic tool. They can save spending hours debugging network issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Network monitoring systems should provide <strong>network maps to assist network administrators in visualizing their networks<\/strong>. Network maps give users a clear and organized visual overview of the devices in a network, their connections, and the most recent status.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some programs just offer a sketching tool, leaving network mapping to the administrator\u2019s expertise. Other platforms, like Acure.io, can perform <strong>auto-discovering<\/strong> of all system elements and their connections and transform them into a full map in the form of topology. You can monitor the health of both the entire system and each configuration item separately and customize the map in a way that suits you the most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Frame-9717-1.png\" alt=\"Network Monitoring Meme\" class=\"wp-image-3743\" srcset=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Frame-9717-1.png 750w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Frame-9717-1-500x300.png 500w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Frame-9717-1-320x192.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Network Monitoring Meme<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Proper visualization helps reduce incident resolution time. With auto-discovered relationships, you can quickly identify the root cause, saving time on troubleshooting rather than searching.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Constant Monitoring \ud83d\udcbb<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Turn-key device responsibilities that specify what needs to be monitored are provided by network monitoring software. Device roles can be changed by network administrators, or new ones can be created entirely. Monitoring tools give network administrators access to a <strong>wide range of monitors<\/strong>. Network administrators should first keep an eye on <strong>CPU<\/strong>, <strong>memory<\/strong>, <strong>disk<\/strong> and <strong>interface usage<\/strong> as well as <strong>Ping availability<\/strong> and <strong>latency<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of network monitoring software also tracks temperature in wire closets and other hardware elements like fans and power supply in switches. Additionally, they may keep an eye on network services like <strong>HTTP<\/strong>, <strong>TCP\/IP<\/strong>, and <strong>FTP<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alerts and Notifications \ud83d\udce7<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Network administrators may respond to issues before they have an impact on users, apps, or the company. That\u2019s why network monitoring systems should <strong>immediately alert network administrators when a problem occurs<\/strong>. They send out notifications by text, email, and logging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CPU, memory, and interface usage are performance measures that change during the day. During times of peak usage, they may go beyond thresholds for a few seconds or minutes. Network administrators don&#8217;t want to deal with these small hiccups. Notifications from monitoring systems are set up with a time element to prevent this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-1024x576.png\" alt=\"IT Networks\" class=\"wp-image-3732\" srcset=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-500x281.png 500w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-320x180.png 320w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-1536x864.png 1536w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-1200x675.png 1200w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15-1568x882.png 1568w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-15.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Network admins also need sleeping mode. But unfortunately, a lot of them should be ready for alerts they are stormed with 24\/7. Some systems allow administrators to set blackout times during which notifications are disabled. Often alerts are duplicated, so many engineers do the same thing, which leads to additional time and money costs. To avoid storm alerts, <strong>monitoring systems use functions of noise reduction<\/strong>.  For example, Acure.io allows sorting events by priority and shows only important notifications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SLA Reports \ud83d\udcc9<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Network administrators are actively involved in the ongoing planning, analysis, and redesign of the network. The network monitoring systems <strong>offer both historical and real-time monitoring data to support this life cycle<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Network administrators can use this information to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Verify that network designs are producing the desired results<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Show that SLA commitments are being met<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Expose trends to deliver the performance required by users, applications, and the business<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rapidly identify and resolve performance issues<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Network monitoring programs are indispensable assistants for every system administrator. They allow you to quickly respond to anomalous activity within the local network, keep abreast of all network processes and, thus, automate some of the administrator&#8217;s routine activities: primarily those related to network security. Let&#8217;s take a look at which network monitoring programs are relevant in 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Popular Network Monitoring Tools (2022)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Zabbix<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.zabbix.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Zabbix<\/a> is a proper solution for networks and applications which uses a fascinating robust tool for monitoring and event correlation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"574\" src=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Zabbix-1024x574.png\" alt=\"Zabbix Network Monitoring Tool Interface\" class=\"wp-image-2708\" srcset=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Zabbix-1024x574.png 1024w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Zabbix-500x280.png 500w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Zabbix-320x179.png 320w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Zabbix-768x430.png 768w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Zabbix-1536x861.png 1536w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Zabbix-1200x672.png 1200w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Zabbix-1568x879.png 1568w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Zabbix-1080x605.png 1080w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Zabbix.png 1904w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Zabbix allows you to <strong>customize your dashboards and web interface <\/strong>to focus on the most important network components. <strong>Notifications and problem escalations<\/strong> can be based on custom actions that are applied to hosts or groups of hosts. Actions can even be configured to run remote commands, so some script of yours can run on a controlled host if certain event criteria are observed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The program graphs <\/strong>shows data such as network bandwidth and CPU usage and collects it for custom display systems. In addition, Zabbix supports customizable maps, screens, and even slideshows showing the current status of monitored devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, Zabbix works with <strong>software agents<\/strong> running on monitored systems. But this solution can also work without agents, using the SNMP protocol or other monitoring capabilities. Zabbix supports VMware and other virtualization hypervisors by providing detailed hypervisor performance and activity data. Particular attention is also paid to the monitoring of Java application servers, web services and databases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hosts <\/strong>can be added manually or through an automatic discovery process. A wide range of default templates apply to the most common use cases such as Linux, FreeBSD and Windows servers; widely used services such as SMTP and HTTP as well as ICMP and IPMI for detailed network hardware monitoring. In addition, custom checks written in Perl, Python or almost any other language can be integrated into Zabbix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83d\udcb0 Zabbix is <strong>free <\/strong>since it was released under the GPL license. There are no limitations on the number of monitored devices, you can use Zabbix to monitor many thousands of devices absolutely free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2.

IT infrastructure is visualized as a <strong>topology graph <\/strong>which shows connections, subordinations and the health of configurations units. IT allows you to quickly and efficiently perform root cause and impact analysis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acure automates not only discovering but also r<strong>ules and actions<\/strong>. You can create scripts and use automation to make changes smoothly to the whole system without extra efforts. The <strong>Plugins system<\/strong> allows the administrator to create and add automated <strong>notification methods<\/strong> via e-mail, sms or popular messengers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acure also <strong>has automated testing feature <\/strong>to set up checks that can imitate user actions and report any anomalies as they run, even when infrastructure monitoring does not signal a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83d\udcb0 <strong>Pricing of this software is $0 <\/strong>which offers: unlimited events, unlimited users, unlimited automation rules, up to 5GB of daily incoming data and up to 100 tests daily.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3.
