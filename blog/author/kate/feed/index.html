<p>Do you want to begin a career in IT but don&#8217;t feel interested in traditional positions like software development? Do you pay close attention to details and enjoy solving minute problems? Finding a career as a site reliability engineer, or SRE, might be the answer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?cmp=RIOS-Intelligent-Machines&amp;t=Site+Reliability+Engineer&amp;jk=3b73ffa575fe9580&amp;q=%22site+Reliability+Engineer%22&amp;vjs=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Site reliability managers</a> primarily focus on automating easy tasks within a system, enhancing system functionality/reducing error, and detecting/fixing problems. The job of an effective SRE is to ensure that systems function as smoothly as possible, eliminating extra work for IT teams and reducing the likelihood of system collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you would like to learn more about becoming an SRE, the professionals at Acure have put together the following guide on SREs. We will break down the characteristics of an ideal SRE candidate, the general requirements for the job, and day-to-day SRE practices. Keep reading to find out more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who Is SRE?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-1024x576.png" alt="SRE picture" class="wp-image-5564" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the past, software development teams created programs without the help of IT teams. After the software teams successfully designed their systems, they pass their work onto an IT team. This IT team would then be responsible&nbsp;for&nbsp;fixing errors, taking calls, and maintaining and deploying the program.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=2cd47692d82bfb8b&amp;tk=1gmdvo10eln1c801&amp;from=serp&amp;vjs=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">site reliability engineer</a>&nbsp;is a position that Google created to streamline IT processes. This position is the bridge between IT operators and software developers, capitalizing upon the practices of DevOps. Where DevOps primarily focuses on ensuring that operation and developer teams work together to create reliable systems and develop products, SREs work to enhance system reliability and resilience.</p>



<p>SREs primarily monitor the following aspects of a system:</p>



<ul>
<li>Website Traffic</li>



<li>System Errors</li>



<li>Saturation/Capacity</li>



<li>System Latency</li>



<li>System Automation</li>



<li>Incident Response</li>
</ul>



<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f449.png" alt="👉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Read more about SRE principles and its benefits for organizations in <a href="https://acure.io/blog/sre/">our previous article</a>.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Career and Salary <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4b0.png" alt="💰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>The average salary of an SRE in the United States is around $100,000 a year. It is also common for SREs to earn bonuses that amount to a little over $20,000 extra a year. The more experience you gain as an SRE, the more money you will make.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Employers are more likely to hire candidates with a degree in computer science, though sufficient certifications and previous background in IT can guarantee you a position in a company. Some companies will allow you to work remotely, while others may require that you come into the office. Popular companies for SREs include Target, Twitter, Adobe, Wayfair, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Role and Responsibilities</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="968" height="528" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SRE-meme-1.png" alt="SRE meme" class="wp-image-5549" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SRE-meme-1.png 968w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SRE-meme-1-500x273.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SRE-meme-1-320x175.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SRE-meme-1-768x419.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 968px) 100vw, 968px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SRE meme</figcaption></figure>



<p>The primary responsibilities of an SRE (or SRE teams) include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixing issues with a program/system</li>



<li>Quickly responding to client problems</li>



<li>Creating software to streamline processes for IT workers</li>



<li>Managing on-call responsibilities</li>



<li>Documenting their knowledge of systems and common errors</li>



<li>Automating&nbsp;system administration</li>



<li>Analyzing&nbsp;past problems to prevent future errors</li>
</ul>



<p>SREs&nbsp;constantly look for new ways to improve systems and reduce common errors or incidents. If such a malfunction occurs, an SRE must address the error quickly. Then, the SRE ought to reflect on how they can prevent such an error from occurring in the future by enhancing the reliability of that system.</p>



<p>Many site reliability engineers use AI programs to streamline their job.&nbsp;<a href="https://acure.io/landing/get-started-with-aiops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Such programs</a>&nbsp;sort through system issues to determine which alerts are important. These AI programs enhance the reliability of an SRE by ensuring that their IT services perform well without wasting time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Skills, Courses, and Certification <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f393.png" alt="🎓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>People who are most suitable for a career in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=584b42f23ad9f46d&amp;tk=1gmdvo10eln1c801&amp;from=serp&amp;vjs=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">system reliability engineering</a>&nbsp;must:</p>



<ul>
<li>Be quick on their feet</li>



<li>Easily understand the basics of a system even if they have not seen it before</li>



<li>Enjoy building complex software and systems</li>



<li>Possess curiosity and a love for learning</li>



<li>Stay calm despite feeling pressured</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond these characteristics, SREs must have some background in IT or software development. However, ideal candidates do not come from a specific discipline in IT. Anyone from a biochemist to a self-taught candidate for sysadmin can find success in a career as an SRE.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Suggested Courses and Skills for SREs</h3>



<p>Having a background and/or certification in certain programs and coding is helpful when applying for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=5ecfd44e5e629928&amp;tk=1gmdvo10eln1c801&amp;from=serp&amp;vjs=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">site reliability engineer</a>&nbsp;jobs. You should learn how to program shell scripts as well as understand programming languages such as C, Rust, Go, Python, and Java.</p>



<p>We also suggest that you learn how to create websites. To do so, either take a course or use cloud servers such as Amazon Web Services or Digital Ocean on your own time. Creating your website by coding your own HTML or using old-school programming methods such as PHP and MySQL can also help you become a better SRE.</p>



<p>Learning about automation through a continuous integration pipeline like Jenkins or Travis CI is also helpful. Furthermore, you should also know some basic code editing skills. Use programs such as Atom or Eclipse for coding practice.</p>



<p>You must also have a basic understanding of NoSQL databases and data models. Understanding Linux and service-oriented architecture (SOA) is also quite helpful. We also recommend you understand monitoring tools and software systems (such as Acure).</p>



<p>Though not all of these skills are necessary to become an SRE, they will help you succeed in your career.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why It Is Important to Collect Metrics</h2>



<p>Metrics are an essential part of data monitoring. They are used to measure, track and analyze the performance of a system, process or activity. Metrics give us a more objective and accurate view of how a system, process or activity is performing, which helps us identify and address potential problems. Metrics provide a quantitative way of measuring progress and performance of a system, process or activity. They also help identify areas where improvements or changes can be made.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What do Metrics Show <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f50d.png" alt="🔍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>



<ul>
<li>First,<strong> metrics help to define what data needs to be monitored</strong>. By setting KPIs and metrics, businesses can identify which data points are most important and focus their resources on gathering and analyzing that data. Without metrics, businesses may find themselves gathering and analyzing data that is not useful or relevant.</li>



<li>Second, <strong>metrics provide an indication of progress</strong>. By tracking certain metrics, businesses can assess their progress toward their goals and objectives. This allows them to adjust their strategies and better focus their resources.</li>



<li>Third, <strong>metrics can help identify areas of improvement</strong>. By tracking key metrics, businesses can identify areas that need improvement, such as customer service times or lead generation. This can result in more efficient and cost-effective operations.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-39-1-1024x576.png" alt="Metrics picture" class="wp-image-5208" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-39-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-39-1-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-39-1-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-39-1-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-39-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-39-1-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-39-1-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-39-1.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Metrics are useful for many applications, including software development, customer service and operational performance. </p>



<p>For software development, metrics can be used to monitor the progress of a project, how quickly tasks are being completed and how defects are being addressed. Metrics can also be used to compare a project&#8217;s performance to that of similar projects or to identify areas where additional effort is needed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Сategories of Metrics</h2>



<p>Metrics can be divided into two main categories: <em>quantitative</em> and <em>qualitative</em>. </p>



<p><strong>Quantitative metrics</strong> measure the performance of a data system in terms of numbers or data points. Examples of quantitative metrics include throughput, latency and error rates. </p>



<p><strong>Qualitative metrics</strong> measure the performance of a data system in terms of user experience or customer satisfaction. Examples of qualitative metrics include customer feedback, user engagement and ease of use.</p>



<p>There are a variety of metrics that can be used to measure performance, depending on the data and the goals of the organization. Some of the most common metrics include:</p>



<p><strong>1. Speed</strong>: How quickly data is processed, stored and read from a system. Speed is typically measured in either megabytes per second (MBps) or megabits per second (Mbps).</p>



<p><strong>2. Availability</strong>: A measure of how often a system is available and how quickly it can respond to requests. This metric is usually expressed as a percentage.</p>



<p><strong>3. Response time</strong>: The amount of time it takes for a system to respond to a user’s request. Response time is usually measure in milliseconds.</p>



<p><strong>4. Latency</strong>: The delay between when a request is made and when it is fulfilled by the system. Latency is typically measured in milliseconds.</p>



<p><strong>5. Throughput</strong>: Measures the amount of work that can be performed by the system within a specific period of time. Throughput is typically measured in number of transactions per second (TPS).</p>



<p><strong>6. Accuracy</strong>: Measures the accuracy of information received from the system. Accuracy is typically measured in the percentage of occurrence of a problem.</p>



<p><strong>7. Reliability</strong>: Measures the probability of the system being available for use when needed. Reliability is typically measured in uptime percentage of time that a system is available for use.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Acure 2.2</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Collection of Metrics in the New Release <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f5c2.png" alt="🗂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>



<p>Of course, all of the above could not be ignored by Acure. Therefore, a notable update in version 2.2 is a basic implementation for collecting and storing metrics in the system. </p>



<p><strong>Сollecting metrics is carried out through the Data Stream.</strong><br>The created data stream allows you to simultaneously receive event information (logs), as well as metric data.</p>



<p>For example, for Prometheus to send metrics to the Data Stream, you will need an API key copied from the settings of the corresponding Data Stream.</p>



<p>Based on this, a full-fledged service for analyzing time series and creating rules for managing thresholds is coming soon. UI for managing metrics in the system to create a signal and link it to CI will be implemented in the next release.</p>

<p>In the new release, Data Streams got a Statistics tab, where users can access information about the events (logs) and metrics collected in the data stream.</p>



<p>Information is presented in the form of histograms with statistical indicators.</p>



<p><strong>The Histogram of Events and Logs</strong> displays the amount of data received through the Data Stream for the selected period of time with the following indicators:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Amount of data for the selected period</em></li>



<li><em>Average amount of data for the selected period = amount of data for the period / number of timeslots of the period</em></li>



<li><em>The maximum amount of data for the selected period = the maximum amount of one of the time intervals of the period</em></li>

However, events from primary systems often have complex names that do not help to simplify the analysis of the state of the infrastructure. Often a time for decision-making is in short supply, so you need to reduce the cognitive load and make the data understandable for perception.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at how to do this in Acure using regular expressions and a new local function.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="536" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Untitled-design-1024x536.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4949" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Untitled-design-1024x536.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Untitled-design-500x262.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Untitled-design-320x167.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Untitled-design-768x402.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Untitled-design.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Event name conversion examples</h2>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Imagine that you receive a problematic event from the primary monitoring system with the name <em>SomeHost: High CPU utilization (over 90% for 5m).</em></p>



<p>For this event, we can apply the following regular expression <em>&#8220;High.CPU.util.*over.(\\d+)%.*&#8221;</em> and open the Signal in a readable form, with the name <em>“CPU &gt; 90%&#8221;.</em></p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> There can be a lot of examples of such transformations, for example, here is another one for a data storage system:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Initial event name: &#8220;C:: Disk space is critically low (used &gt; 90%)&#8221;</em></li>



<li><em>Regular expression: &#8220;(.*): Disk space.*used.&gt;.(.*)%.*&#8221;</em></li>



<li><em>Resulting pattern: &#8220;$1 Storage Partition Usage &gt; $2%&#8221;</em></li>



<li><em>Signal Name: &#8220;C: Storage Partition Usage &gt; 90%&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We have implemented this request in the automation script as a local function that instantly converts values according to the dictionary defined in the same function. Unlike hard-coded global functions, local functions are a playground where you can implement any of your ideas within a C# script.</p>

If there is no matching regular expression in the dictionary, the original value will be returned.</p>
