Though they are used interchangeably, both terms have a crucial difference.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ITIL is formerly known as the &#8220;Information Technology Infrastructure Library.&#8221; It was created by the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Central_Computer_and_Telecommunications_Agency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency<\/a> (CCTA) under the backing of the UK government. ITIL is a registered trademark of the British government&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/dictionary.cambridge.org\/dictionary\/english\/office-of-government-commerce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OGC<\/a> (Office of Government Commerce).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ITIL was developed to define the organization&#8217;s structure and look into the skill requirements of the IT organization. In addition, it was created to introduce standard operational management practices and procedures for an organization to manage an IT operation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In simpler words, ITIL is a framework of all the best recommendations and practices for managing a firm&#8217;s IT services and operations for the firm&#8217;s improvement. It provides a set of guidelines for efficient and effective IT service management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Difference between ITSM and ITIL<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, there is a critical difference between ITSM and ITIL. ITSM is a model or a paradigm, whereas ITIL is a framework of best practices.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">IT Service Management<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ITSM is a model for understanding the relationship between an IT organization and the firm it supports in a specific way. ITSM paradigm helps IT firms focus on managing all their services and delivering services to the business the firm supports.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>IT Service Management model can be summarized as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The function or goal of an IT organization is to provide services to the firm.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>All the services provided must align and help accomplish all the goals and needs of the company.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The services provided must be managed thoroughly and throughout their entire lifecycle.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The IT sector or department is its organization, whereas the business is its customer.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ITIL<strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While ITSM defines the relationship between the business and IT organization, ITIL is more than that. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.itlibrary.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ITIL<\/a> is a framework that helps manage IT services throughout the service lifecycle effectively and efficiently.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ITIL is a collection of values, strategies, and processes that will assist in executing ITSM.&nbsp; There are other ITSM frameworks, but ITIL is popular and most used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\ud83d\udcc8 The Benefits of IT Service Management<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various benefits of implementing IT service management in the company.
