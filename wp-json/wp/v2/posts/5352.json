ITIL<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to master ITIL as this is the industry standard for IT technology operations management jobs. The ITIL principles and processes govern every aspect of IT and define the protocol for IT within an organization. Mastering ITIL will put you ahead of the game when it comes to the IT operations manager career path.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Project Management<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>IT managers must have strong project management skills to be efficient. This encompasses managing the scope of various internal and external projects related to the IT department. From handling timelines to overseeing budgets and negotiating with software vendors, project management is one of the less technical skills that a good IT operations manager will need to master.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. A Strong Knowledge of the Cloud<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An IT operations manager must have a strong understanding of the cloud and should know how to manage all aspects of cloud services. A strong skill set in cloud computing will ensure the efficient handling of software and the effective training of staff members. IT operations managers oversee everything cloud-related, from planning the migration of files to designing and implementing cloud-based IT solutions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Acure<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>IT Ops managers can&#8217;t manually oversee every component of the IT infrastructure. A working knowledge of the most popular monitoring software is crucial as an IT Ops manager. Acure is a popular software tool that IT operations managers use to facilitate automated actions and root cause analysis. Acure is a powerful tool for effective process management, automation, and preparing for and responding to downtime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udca1<\/strong> <strong>Read more about features of the last Acure update <a href=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/blog\/metrics-acure-2-2\/\">in our blog<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Excellent Strategizing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An IT manager will need to have strategic thinking and a careful approach. Often they are in charge of setting up an entire technology infrastructure, including all of the computer systems. They will need to be able to plan out the software and hardware, deploy software updates throughout the organization, and design scalable processes. One key aspect of IT management is developing a strategy for anticipating the future technology needs of a business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Communication<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you are manning the service desk and assisting employees with IT issues or designing a plan to migrate data to the cloud, you&#8217;ll be working with people. Good communication skills are a must as an IT ops manager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Educational Requirements to Become an IT Ops Manager \ud83c\udf93<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to statistics, roughly 63% of operations managers have a bachelor&#8217;s degree, and 13% have a master&#8217;s degree. However, the position focuses more on experience than on educational qualifications. It is possible to become an IT ops manager without attending college.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/108-1024x576.png\" alt=\"IT operations manager education picture\" class=\"wp-image-5360\" srcset=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/108-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/108-500x281.png 500w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/108-320x180.png 320w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/108-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/108-1536x864.png 1536w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/108-1200x675.png 1200w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/108-1568x882.png 1568w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/108.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ITIL Certification<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Obtaining an ITIL certificate is a key aspect of the IT ops career path. This certificate will help you earn more and improve your chances of advancing to IT operations manager.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bachelor&#8217;s Degree<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While a bachelor&#8217;s degree is not a firm requirement to succeed in the tech industry, it does put you a step ahead of the competition. The most typical majors for IT operations managers are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Computer science<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Business<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Information technology<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting a bachelor&#8217;s degree in technology management is also helpful in the career path to becoming an IT operations manager. This degree will help you get jobs in database development, analysis, programming, and other entry-level IT roles.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have the necessary experience and education, you can move up to a more advanced position as a supervisor or manager. Ultimately the career path can go as far as a Chief Technology Officer or IT Director.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Master&#8217;s Degree<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Obtaining a master&#8217;s degree will prove beneficial if your goal is to rise to more advanced roles in the IT division, such as management. Many employers will want to know that you have invested time in becoming educated in the field. However, if you have many years of experience in IT, you won&#8217;t need a master&#8217;s degree to get a position as an IT operations manager.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you choose to pursue a master&#8217;s degree, select a course of study that highlights technical, strategic, and management-focused skills.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The 7 Best IT Operations Management Courses in 2023 \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfeb<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/course\/servicenow-it-operations-management\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ServiceNow IT Operations Management<\/a>: This two-hour on-demand course offers in-depth instruction about The ServiceNow Graphical Interface.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/coned.georgebrown.ca\/courses-and-programs\/it-operations-management-transformation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">IT Operations Management Transformation<\/a>: This comprehensive course covers IT management processes and approaches.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/executive-ed.xpro.mit.edu\/chief-operating-officer-program?utm_source=DigDefynd&amp;utm_medium=Affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=B-365D_WW_AF_DigDefynd_MO-COO_ALWON&amp;utm_content=ddoperationsmanagement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MIT Chief Operating Officer Program<\/a>: Learn how to use and evaluate IT technologies, processes, and systems in these online classes taught by top professionals and academic faculty.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/iimk.emeritus.org\/iimk-advanced-operations-management-analytics\/index-af.php?utm_source=Digdefynd&amp;utm_medium=Affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=IS_IN_IIMK_AOMA_AF_Digdefynd_Jun_22&amp;utm_term=SubAffID&amp;utm_content=ddopmgmt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Advanced Operations Management &amp; Analytics by IIM Kozhikode<\/a>: This is a masterful course that teaches the tenets of advanced concepts in analytics and operations management.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/gaqm.org\/certifications\/management_certifications\/citm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Global Association of Quality Management Certificate<\/a>: This certificate program offers a comprehensive understanding of corporate frameworks, information systems, software, communication, and management of technology personnel.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/learn\/operations-management?utm_source=aw&amp;utm_medium=affiliate_partner&amp;utm_content=text-link&amp;utm_term=427859_Digital+Defynd&amp;awc=6798_1673616066_684c8616937b3062d62879381135ea55\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">edX Operations Management<\/a>: This complete operations management course is your path to understanding tools for productivity and operations management.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/itmlinstitute.org\/itmlp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ITML Instit<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/itmlinstitute.org\/itmlp\/\">ute Course<\/a>: This certification bootcamp workshop helps IT operations managers widen their knowledge and learn new strategies.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Good luck!
