Instead of hard coding, visual constructors are used for application modeling and ready-made scripts are used to solve typical tasks. For low-code development, the process involves moving blocks with ready-made code using the drag-and-drop principle and getting a product with the desired functionality. Ready-made modules in low-code speed up work with typical tasks and eliminate repetitive actions but code can be used for individual solutions, settings and personalization. Development in the platform takes place according to ready-made templates or freely. Integrations and built-in services are also supported.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main value of low-coding is the ability to do without programmers when you need to create or change some kind of application, module or even product. To carry out the necessary work, the competencies of the platform administrator will be more than enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of Low-coding \ud83d\udc4d<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Low-code platforms require less development time and give more flexibility in setting up processes. There is no need to plan the architecture, create prototypes, analyze and develop the UI since it is assumed that this is all implemented in the low-code platform itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/KEH4T3bT6nmcabEsx6r--C39GcDyEOeG8-yQVu7vAJFV9wtdZYR3BV2fSELEDMX8ysMHBlI7KW_FDFjazK1HxWP9vLwSJHQ3jMFy3UmE-lfyIMtizgDCqeg1Rf99UTgSa01L-0D1Sj_AdE10VBGtMR5XfV0QD-7fxpvOJYuIgk3wcJ0ouJVfZPtqI14qb89GBV60O0JkhQ\" alt=\"Low-code meme\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Such platforms integrate with a wide range of systems and allow you to add new features to any application. In addition, manufacturers of low-code platforms talk about their greater security for other applications and stability compared to self-written elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The main elements of low-code platforms are:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. <\/strong>Visual modeling<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.<\/strong> Ready-made components, built-in services<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. <\/strong>Rapid deployment of applications, focus on DevOps<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. <\/strong>Pattern development or abstract development<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the company&#8217;s IT specialists in this case no longer have to write a lot of code, the need for these competencies is reduced and, in turn, the ability of staff to build solutions from ready-made components is prioritized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Low-code Automation in Acure<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Acure Automation Service is a high-performance environment for launching and executing custom scripts. Scenarios can be both custom and supplied by the developers themselves as full-fledged services. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automation scripts allow you to <strong>automatically discover new configuration items, the relationships between them and update the service map in real-time without any manual manipulation<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the help of low-code scenarios, you can also <strong>create signals &#8211; special dynamic objects that allow you to correlate and deduplicate incoming events and alerts<\/strong>. Read more about this functionality in<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/blog\/acure-2-0\/\">the article discussing Acure 2.0<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The low-code engine is used to create automatic scripts. Automation scripts in Acure help significantly expand the functionality of the system and create arbitrary event processing scenarios using visual blocks and establishing links between them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"555\" src=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Frame-9719-1024x555.png\" alt=\"Acure Automation pipeline \" class=\"wp-image-4698\" srcset=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Frame-9719-1024x555.png 1024w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Frame-9719-500x271.png 500w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Frame-9719-320x173.png 320w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Frame-9719-768x416.png 768w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Frame-9719.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, low-code, as described above, means a significant reduction in the use of complex hard coding but does not at all relieve you of the need to learn the logic of building scripts and memorizing functions and variables. And if you are now holding your breath in anticipation of a ton of complex information, calmly exhale. Acure &#8216;s low-\u0441ode instruments are no more complicated than the cheat code in your favorite games, and also as a result make life just as easy. Further, you will be convinced of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Low-code Instruments in Acure<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Start events <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Any script must start with a \u201cstartup\u201d. Startup events are responsible for this &#8211; blocks that initiate the launch of the script and contain the event model. If a script contains multiple start blocks, it can run on any of them. The composition of the starting blocks is determined by the route map settings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the script is running, it is time for <strong>variables<\/strong> and <strong>functions<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Functions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two types of functions in Acure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"555\" src=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Frame-9720-1024x555.png\" alt=\"Functions\" class=\"wp-image-4701\" srcset=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Frame-9720-1024x555.png 1024w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Frame-9720-500x271.png 500w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Frame-9720-320x173.png 320w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Frame-9720-768x416.png 768w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Frame-9720.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Impure functions<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The function is executed every time the input is called from the previous block<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>The ArrayAddElement<\/em> function requests all the data passed to it as input<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This function only works once.

For Wildcard pins the type of connection is set either manually or when establishing a connection. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For WC pins, there are also requirements in the context of each function. More about this is written in the documentation when describing each type of function.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also certain requirements for establishing links. For example, when pinning a function call, one-to-many communications are prohibited, but many-to-one are allowed.
