<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="importance-of-data-observability">The Importance of Data Observability</h2>



<p>The use of data observability is becoming increasingly important as organizations strive to gain analytical insights from their data. By proactively looking at the data they have available, companies are able to identify trends and issues that could be critical in making decisions and shaping strategies. With accurate and timely observations based on collected data, organizations can quickly detect problems before they become bigger issues, minimizing risk and potential costs. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Big Data&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong></strong></h2>



<p>Big data refers to the <strong>enormous</strong>, complicated <strong>volumes of data</strong> that might be either structured or unstructured. However, what organizations do with the data impacts more than just the nature or volume of data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Big data, notably from new data sources, is simply a term for <strong>bigger, more intricate data collections</strong>. These data compilations are so large that already existing data processing software face difficulties handling it. However, these great data compilations can be taken advantage of to solve issues that were nearly impossible to solve earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Big-Data-meme.jpg" alt="Big Data meme" class="wp-image-4802" width="610" height="325" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Big-Data-meme.jpg 750w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Big-Data-meme-500x267.jpg 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Big-Data-meme-320x171.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Big Data meme</figcaption></figure>



<p>Big data analysis will help generate information that will eventually help with the decision-making stages and provide support while making critical business implementations.</p>



<p>The emergence of big data depended on the creation of open-source frameworks, making massive data more manageable and less expensive to keep.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Popular V’s of Big Data <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/270c.png" alt="✌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Industry analyst <strong>Doug Laney </strong>introduced the <strong>three V&#8217;s</strong> in the early 2000s that defined big data in easy-to-understand statements. Let&#8217;s look at the V&#8217;s that together give meaning to big data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Initially, only <strong>volume, velocity, and variety</strong> were the V’s that were introduced but later on, <strong>veracity and value</strong> were also included in the list.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="582" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5Vs-of-Big-Data-2-1024x582.jpg" alt="5 Vs of Big Data" class="wp-image-4834" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5Vs-of-Big-Data-2-1024x582.jpg 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5Vs-of-Big-Data-2-500x284.jpg 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5Vs-of-Big-Data-2-320x182.jpg 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5Vs-of-Big-Data-2-768x436.jpg 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5Vs-of-Big-Data-2.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Volume&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The initial of the important V&#8217;s of big data, volume, refers to the <strong>quantity of data that is available to us</strong>. Volume, or the original size and quantity of information obtained, can be thought of as creating and giving basis to the foundation of big data. Big data can be used to describe a sufficiently massive set of data.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Velocity&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Velocity refers to the <strong>high speed</strong> at which big data is accumulated. The speed at which data is created and managed to satisfy demands influences the data&#8217;s potential where a significant and constant flow of data is present.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data comes from various sources, including social media platforms, databases, computers, smartphones, etc. Dealing with problems like &#8220;velocity&#8221; might be easier compared to other difficult sampling problems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Variety&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The <strong>range and diversity of data </strong>kinds are referred to as variety. An organization may collect data from various sources, the value of which may differ. Data might originate both inside and outside of an organization. Unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data can be collected. The standardization and dissemination of all the data being gathered pose a problem in terms of variety.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Veracity&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Veracity relates to <strong>sampling errors and uncertainty</strong> that is, readily available data can occasionally become disorganized, and both quality and precision are challenging to manage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gathered information can be incomplete, erroneous, or unable to offer any useful, insightful information. <strong>Veracity, in general, refers to the degree of confidence in the data that has been gathered</strong>. Because there are so many different data dimensions arising from several dissimilar data types and sources, big data is also unpredictable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Value&nbsp;</h3>



<p>This is a reference to the <strong>benefits using big data </strong>can offer, and it has a direct bearing on what businesses can do with the information they gather. Data by itself is useless and unimportant; information must be extracted from it by transforming it into something worthwhile. Therefore, value can be identified as the most significant of the five virtues.</p>



<p>It is necessary to be able to extract value from big data because the importance of big data greatly depends on the conclusions that can be obtained from them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Interesting Trends Emerging in the Big Data Industry</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Data Quality Testing<strong></strong></h3>



<p>Data quality checking protects your company from inaccurate data. It&#8217;s time to think about a remedy if the quality of the company&#8217;s information assets is affecting sales.</p>

<p>For businesses across all industries, accurate data is crucial for statistics and data-driven solutions. Without this information, businesses struggle to remain effective, profitable, and competitive in their market.</p>



<p><strong>Preserving data quality</strong> is essential to creating a successful company, especially given how many aspects of daily operations it now supports. <strong>Better company decisions</strong> are made as a result of high-quality data, which also benefits customers.</p>



<p>Writing test strategies for certain products and initiatives that concentrate on the project&#8217;s objectives will be necessary. Before creating and running tests, data sources need to be reviewed after such criteria have been determined.</p>



<p>To provide IT and data owners with an audit record of all access instances, live monitoring, mapping, and alerting of exactly <strong>who is receiving and accessing which type of data when and from where </strong>helps keep them aware as to how sensitive data is being utilized. The procedure guards against data breaches and misuse.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Anomaly Detection<strong></strong></h3>



<p>Data mining&#8217;s <strong>anomaly detection</strong> process, also known as outlier analysis, seeks out data points, occasions, and/or observations that differ from a dataset&#8217;s typical pattern of activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unusual data can point to serious occurrences, like a technological malfunction, or promising opportunities, like a shift in consumer behavior. Automated anomaly detection is increasingly being done using<strong> machine learning.</strong></p>



<p>You may use your resources more wisely because <strong>monitoring systems will keep hold of your infrastructure,</strong> including many other things. You will become more productive as a result, which is undoubtedly essential in your decision to utilize a monitoring system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the knowledge that you will be notified as soon as an issue occurs, your employees will have more time to focus on other activities.</p>



<p>However, with data monitoring, the data is automatically verified to make sure it is accurate at every stage. If a discrepancy is discovered, the data is flagged so that it may be reviewed and any necessary modifications can be made. <strong>Your analytics and reporting become more reliable as a result.</strong></p>



<p>The analytics reports may become biased if any data is altered. These reports are designed to assess the company&#8217;s performance and identify areas for improvement. But you can&#8217;t choose the best course of action for your company and customers if you don&#8217;t have the appropriate information.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Shift from Data Monitoring to Data Observability<strong></strong></h3>



<p>Teams from DevOps and ITOps must advance from monitoring to observability. Software and systems that can be seen and used to provide answers to inquiries about their behavior are said to be observable.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/83-1024x576.jpg" alt="Data Observability picture" class="wp-image-4804" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/83-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/83-500x281.jpg 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/83-320x180.jpg 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/83-768x432.jpg 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/83-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/83-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/83-1568x882.jpg 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/83.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>By releasing data from compartmentalized log analytics programs, observable systems encourage research as opposed to monitoring, which depends on fixed views of static resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can <strong>engage with customers better</strong> the more precise the data is. Monitoring data along with observability enhances connections in a variety of ways. Furthermore, accurate information reveals any potential areas for improvement. You can concentrate on customer retention rather than gaining new customers if your analytics suggest that you frequently acquire new customers but rarely see those same customers return.</p>



<p><strong>Correct data monitoring and observability reveals the demographics of your clients</strong>. This data can be utilized to target your consumer base more accurately, saving you money on marketing to uninterested parties.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Low-Code and No-Code</h3>



<p>More and more companies have recently been trying to make their solutions more flexible, allowing data engineers to independently adjust systems for themselves and customize functionality without having deep knowledge in programming. Low-code and no-code come to the rescue in this case, when you can create entire scripts without writing long lines of code. </p>



<p><strong><em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4dd.png" alt="📝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We talked about this approach in more detail <a href="https://acure.io/blog/low-code-in-acure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the article.</a> </em></strong></p>



<p>This is a very promising direction in light of the data decentralization trends and skill shortage.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Cure for Big Data</h2>



<p>Acure.io is one of the fresh and promising solutions for working with big data. It is not just another monitoring system, it is an AIOps platform that integrates all other log and alert monitoring systems, takes data from there, puts it on a single dynamic link map, and automates the processes of monitoring it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1081" height="675" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Service-Model-window-edited.png" alt="Dependencies Map in Acure" class="wp-image-4807" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Service-Model-window-edited.png 1081w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Service-Model-window-edited-500x312.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Service-Model-window-edited-1024x639.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Service-Model-window-edited-320x200.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Service-Model-window-edited-768x480.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1081px) 100vw, 1081px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dependencies map in Acure.io</figcaption></figure>



<p>The dependency map is built automatically based on data from existing monitoring systems and other tools. This is vital for dynamic environments, such as modern cloud ecosystems and microservices on Kubernetes. It not only improves data observability but also provides rapid identification of the root cause of an incident and the impact of various technical resources on business services.</p>



<p>In order to avoid information noise, a solution called Signals is used. It aggregates, normalizes and enriches events collected from various monitoring tools and automatically correlates alerts into actionable insights.</p>



<p>As for automation, here Acure also follows trends and uses a Low-code scripting engine (including auto-building and auto-correlation). Running built-in scripted automation tools with low-code and external runbooks allows workflows to be automated for faster incident response.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="553" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Low-code-engine-1024x553.png" alt="Low-code in Acure" class="wp-image-4808" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Low-code-engine-1024x553.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Low-code-engine-500x270.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Low-code-engine-320x173.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Low-code-engine-768x415.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Low-code-engine-1200x648.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Low-code-engine.png 1504w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Low-code in Acure.io</figcaption></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>The final analysis and the implemented choices can only be foolproof if the data has been handled well and can be trusted. Being dynamic has several advantages. Organizations that are data-driven perform better, have more predictable operations and are significantly profitable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Businesses must fully take advantage of the benefits provided by big data to remain at the top of the pop league. They must also go for a more data-driven path so that they can base their choices more on the facts provided by big data rather than just relying on intuition.</p>



<p>Businesses use big data analytics to reap benefits and understanding from large quantities of data. Big data is being used to fuel modern advanced analytics projects like AI and machine learning.<br><br></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Low-code?</h2>



<p>Low-code is a development method that minimizes manual programming. Instead of hard coding, visual constructors are used for application modeling and ready-made scripts are used to solve typical tasks. For low-code development, the process involves moving blocks with ready-made code using the drag-and-drop principle and getting a product with the desired functionality. Ready-made modules in low-code speed up work with typical tasks and eliminate repetitive actions but code can be used for individual solutions, settings and personalization. Development in the platform takes place according to ready-made templates or freely. Integrations and built-in services are also supported.</p>



<p>The main value of low-coding is the ability to do without programmers when you need to create or change some kind of application, module or even product. To carry out the necessary work, the competencies of the platform administrator will be more than enough.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of Low-coding <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="👍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Low-code platforms require less development time and give more flexibility in setting up processes. There is no need to plan the architecture, create prototypes, analyze and develop the UI since it is assumed that this is all implemented in the low-code platform itself.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KEH4T3bT6nmcabEsx6r--C39GcDyEOeG8-yQVu7vAJFV9wtdZYR3BV2fSELEDMX8ysMHBlI7KW_FDFjazK1HxWP9vLwSJHQ3jMFy3UmE-lfyIMtizgDCqeg1Rf99UTgSa01L-0D1Sj_AdE10VBGtMR5XfV0QD-7fxpvOJYuIgk3wcJ0ouJVfZPtqI14qb89GBV60O0JkhQ" alt="Low-code meme"/></figure>



<p>Such platforms integrate with a wide range of systems and allow you to add new features to any application. In addition, manufacturers of low-code platforms talk about their greater security for other applications and stability compared to self-written elements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The main elements of low-code platforms are:</h4>



<p><strong>1. </strong>Visual modeling</p>



<p><strong>2.</strong> Ready-made components, built-in services</p>



<p><strong>3. </strong>Rapid deployment of applications, focus on DevOps</p>



<p><strong>4. </strong>Pattern development or abstract development</p>



<p>Since the company&#8217;s IT specialists in this case no longer have to write a lot of code, the need for these competencies is reduced and, in turn, the ability of staff to build solutions from ready-made components is prioritized.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Low-code Automation in Acure</h2>



<p>Acure Automation Service is a high-performance environment for launching and executing custom scripts. Scenarios can be both custom and supplied by the developers themselves as full-fledged services. </p>



<p>Automation scripts allow you to <strong>automatically discover new configuration items, the relationships between them and update the service map in real-time without any manual manipulation</strong>.</p>



<p>With the help of low-code scenarios, you can also <strong>create signals &#8211; special dynamic objects that allow you to correlate and deduplicate incoming events and alerts</strong>. Read more about this functionality in<strong> <a href="https://acure.io/blog/acure-2-0/">the article discussing Acure 2.0</a>.</strong></p>



<p>The low-code engine is used to create automatic scripts. Automation scripts in Acure help significantly expand the functionality of the system and create arbitrary event processing scenarios using visual blocks and establishing links between them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="555" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9719-1024x555.png" alt="Acure Automation pipeline " class="wp-image-4698" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9719-1024x555.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9719-500x271.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9719-320x173.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9719-768x416.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9719.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Of course, low-code, as described above, means a significant reduction in the use of complex hard coding but does not at all relieve you of the need to learn the logic of building scripts and memorizing functions and variables. And if you are now holding your breath in anticipation of a ton of complex information, calmly exhale. Acure &#8216;s low-сode instruments are no more complicated than the cheat code in your favorite games, and also as a result make life just as easy. Further, you will be convinced of it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Low-code Instruments in Acure</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Start events </h3>



<p>Any script must start with a “startup”. Startup events are responsible for this &#8211; blocks that initiate the launch of the script and contain the event model. If a script contains multiple start blocks, it can run on any of them. The composition of the starting blocks is determined by the route map settings.</p>



<p>When the script is running, it is time for <strong>variables</strong> and <strong>functions</strong>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Functions</h3>



<p>There are two types of functions in Acure.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="555" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9720-1024x555.png" alt="Functions" class="wp-image-4701" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9720-1024x555.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9720-500x271.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9720-320x173.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9720-768x416.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9720.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Impure functions</h4>



<ul>
<li>The function is executed every time the input is called from the previous block</li>



<li><em>The ArrayAddElement</em> function requests all the data passed to it as input</li>



<li>This function only works once. To use the result of a function, it is not necessary to call it again</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Pure functions</h4>



<ul>
<li>The function is executed each time its result is requested. Accordingly, to use the result, it will need to be called every time, like Batman.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Variables</h3>



<p>Variables are divided into two types.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Local</h4>



<ul>
<li>Initialized within the current scenario or manually by the user, or using the SET block</li>



<li>Can be called or initialized anywhere in the current script</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">System</h4>



<ul>
<li>Are providers of information about the script, owner, or current space</li>



<li>Not initialized by the user. They act only as a source</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="555" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9722-1024x555.png" alt="Variables" class="wp-image-4702" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9722-1024x555.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9722-500x271.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9722-320x173.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9722-768x416.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Frame-9722.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Now you will ask: what about data types supported in Acure? Acure <strong>supports multiple types of data but you can only link to pins of the same type.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The following values are possible for types:</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Boolean: True / False ;</li>



<li>Byte: Integers from 1 to 255;</li>



<li>Char: A single Unicode character ;</li>



<li>Double: ±5.0 × 10 <sup>−324 </sup>to ±1.7 × <sup>10308</sup></li>



<li>Dynamic: any object;</li>



<li>GUID: Format value 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000;</li>



<li>Integer: -2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647;</li>



<li>Integer64: -9 223 372 036 854 775 808 to 9 223 372 036 854 775 807;</li>



<li>String: Unicode character string</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>The type can be either Single or Array.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Wildcard Pins And Connections</h3>



<p>It is also worth noting that <strong>some functions can work with different data types</strong>. For convenience, in such cases, Wildcard pins are used. For Wildcard pins the type of connection is set either manually or when establishing a connection. </p>



<p>For WC pins, there are also requirements in the context of each function. More about this is written in the documentation when describing each type of function.</p>



<p>There are also certain requirements for establishing links. For example, when pinning a function call, one-to-many communications are prohibited, but many-to-one are allowed. With a data transfer pin, the opposite is true.</p>

<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2139.png" alt="ℹ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>You can find more information about every function in the corresponding section of the <a href="https://docs.acure.io/current/en/automation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acure documentation</a>. </strong></p>



<p>In this article, let&#8217;s walk through building a simple Autodiscovery scenario.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Creating A Simple Autodiscovery Scenario</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, automation scripts in Acure allow you to minimize manual actions, which is especially important when monitoring dynamic environments. After writing several scripts on the low-code engine, you no longer need to think about making changes to the service model yourself. A dynamic map of IT infrastructure links with all configuration items and links will be built and updated automatically.</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> No shaman tambourines &#8211; all the magic happens <strong>on the scenario builder page</strong>.</p>



<p>By default, there is a start block that runs the script every time the corresponding event arrives.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hyGlTKOGDiV2Y54oY8x9fp1dRpX7Ieu9Knr5n1Y87hdKWJS3-VyvlQb41tqScWG8WOhcAsD4WVlhIsl9F4usiVmCdENVG3S540jABNHF3FMe9rIEh3HpwLpo5rNHzwjuSeMREuhLzd5yCAnupthr54nOFAr1XbicI3SX4Cn2sShmRRa2cvgiVaKylSMyxIwluKL3O5HHCg" alt="OnLogEvent"/></figure>



<p>First, you need to create a rule so that the sequence is executed on specific events. To do this, you need some functions in the form of blocks. You can add them from the context menu by right-clicking on an empty space.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zEjr4vqpa1sJpmKoS0fe0f2ag3DAy6U2kepuhHI6b8Xcw9DjrifzRydAd8DrA65LvY8XaRbTTLsF1NPqs0ztkRY19OQfP9gvbijHIh2KNs1szFJ_TbixiZjJ_iyto8knGDTaUUjS-xtNL3ROXJ2TI1m-bdutD3PqNlkJ_l1BrsVVPjnAaIoQ4Z95bXjqXuAbHJ4FDY2XPA" alt="Low-code part"/></figure>



<p>Let’s build a simple rule that will receive only those events that came from a specific stream.</p>



<p>For that, add the&nbsp;<em>FiltredByStreamId</em>&nbsp;function and connect the sequence in such a way that when an event arrives in the system, the script checks the ID of the stream from which it came and, if the filtering is successful, the script will continue to run.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PzCbe_WePJwPtg0bOkHGZszyd2eDRJVi_zXHscp85wUHN03U4NbQ3zNr5D8rO3v-RGqzofzjAslUQK_IiC0QPSMD8CRGRFWp2OcR1HpJ0QlcatXoaaEGrGlLjVE1eIZImgLd93ldn6Wf-1PmZAQxp4g2CPq761SvAWJ-8Get38n0vB5iH7zIwB8A5AQdgxUlotAu49Hd1A" alt="Low-code part"/></figure>



<p>The sequence of execution of script functions is indicated by blue arrows — exact pins.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/dYREA4brPxFWVbCz7yxLurBqmz0sKiw_ZSqyEyKsRRn9JgSL8hPqak1tb_uf6PEvEluAOd0EtZQr5H5AE4vHbiukVNd-2-t4M3DJWB0Y4jZgQhq4eBzT6ddujJ2LyXeDco_TGCr0f9j_nrVw3-3DeJWKNNOQ6ffFJaut3fIFORGNDn3v8aH0ohetfdgcCakh2y9ihaYyrg" alt="Low-code part"/></figure>



<p>Note that in addition to exact pins, there are data pins. If the former is responsible for the sequence, then the latter is responsible for transmitting and receiving data.</p>



<p>Now let’s analyze our function. For it to be executed, it must be provided with input data. In our case, the function requests an incoming stream model and filtering parameters (stream id).</p>



<p>We must get the initial data from the primary event, i.e., take away the stream model. To do this, we decompose the original structure using the base function and establish a connection with our filter.</p>



<p>Now we need to specify the required parameter (we take it from the previously created stream) and copy-paste it into the&nbsp;<em>FiltredByStreamId</em>&nbsp;block.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TDp2F_ac4qd_7Ut6I6Z7h-1lqdhuPd_-S6UqpR7o_J1UoNeil_M8wkGwBezYXHDbIR7iVJUINw2yxTvRhgik8WWL9KPgA52l2RVC1Imjey9pZBeXHJt7YDvuOg4bZ47W3ccTquw26OfgBHAbuu3-LNqNChghXmDZeR5M4O9EAjlEzFegwzx7GCj7aaPIpNvjdELqjhKi2w" alt="FilterByStreamId"/></figure>



<p>Done! The simple rule is ready. Now, further actions will be executed only if the event came from the stream we specified.</p>



<p>Let’s look at the other tools that are available in the editor as well.</p>



<p>The left panel contains the objects of the current scenario. Here you can create and manage local variables, structures and entire functions. From here, they can be added to the screen for use in a script or selected for further customization.</p>



<p>The settings are available in the right panel where we fill in all the required fields and, in the case of a local function, write the executable code.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ly0qolZANqFTZjT1mAzd-1HIWX8K18PfxhjtYV4nvGHqV23-8ITf-ZdG8IeTOzJj3jLFJkPLnpdrpBTvtHvTsOenhyv6ppCnu6L9stxPsRB3iqMBRcZjTo-fouTuZbaEw8RCec9jRJbgovnXVnERxmHOaYHH-Nmvwhy6qOIorPr9iYxNu9Y5xha-vI7DAnrJORyfKxjn2g" alt="Executable code"/></figure>



<p>To show off your awesome script or make it easier for your team, you can export the script and share it with others. The recipient, using the import tool, creates an exact copy of this script.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is Low-code the Future?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The numbers say yes. <a href="https://www.mendix.com/press/low-code-software-development-from-crisis-technology-to-core-technology-says-new-mendix-sponsored-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The 2022 Mendix State of Low-Code study </a>showed a rise in low-code adoption from 77% in 2021 to 94% IN 2022, with four out of 10 companies now using low-code for mission-critical decisions. The study argues that the spread of low-code may soon lead to the overthrow of more &#8220;traditional&#8221; forms of operations. This report cites Gartner&#8217;s forecast that by 2025, low-code solutions will account for 70% of apps, up from 25% in 2020.</p>



<p>At the same time, the scope of low-code products will also be constantly expanding. This technology has already become a trend and subsequently, the entire market will be rebuilt under it.</p>



<p>All this suggests that the market will increasingly be oriented toward simple solutions when any mass user will be able to automate the solution of routine tasks and satisfy needs without deep programming knowledge. At the same time, the growing needs of users stimulate low-code technology to develop faster and improve functions. Thus, low-code systems will be able to solve more and more complex problems as they develop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The abbreviation AIOps stands for <strong>Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations</strong>. AIOps refers to the process of <strong>automating and enhancing IT operations</strong> by using <strong>analytics and machine technology</strong> on large chunks of data. Vast quantities of network and device data can be automatically analyzed to detect patterns that can be used to both predict and avoid future problems. Also, it can help pinpoint the root cause of problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This term was first introduced by <strong><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/aiops-artificial-intelligence-operations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gartner</a>. </strong>AIOps aims to provide IT operations with the agility and precision of Artificial Intelligence. </p>



<p>Now Gartner publish<a href="https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/aiops-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> an annual rating for top AIOps platfroms</a>. These platforms analyze telemetry and events, and identify meaningful patterns that provide insights to support proactive responses. </p>



<p>It is said the most of AIOps platforms have the particular 5 characteristics: </p>



<ul>
<li>Cross-domain data ingestion and analytics;</li>



<li>Topology assembly from implicit and explicit sources of asset relationship and dependency;</li>



<li>Correlation between related or redundant events associated with an incident;</li>



<li> Pattern recognition to detect incidents, their leading indicators or probable root cause;</li>



<li> Association of probable remediation.</li>
</ul>



<p>We`d like to add 3 more features. Here they are&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Features of AIOps&nbsp;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/37-1024x576.png" alt="Features of AIOps pic" class="wp-image-4223" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/37-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/37-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/37-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/37-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/37-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/37-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/37-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/37.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Data Correlation <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4ca.png" alt="📊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>



<p>The capacity of AIOps platforms to <strong>absorb, organize, and analyze data from various sources with quality and speed</strong> that would be unsurpassed by the efforts put in by humans to analyze is one of their distinguishing features. This gives IT teams a great chance to overcome some of the obstacles they frequently encounter when handling IT crises manually.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Data Mapping <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f333.png" alt="🌳" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>



<p>AIOps can be utilized to <strong>map out dependencies across various domains using intelligence concerning systems, applications, and various service resources</strong>. This is a major help for the processes involved in change and configuration management which have usually struggled in the past due to a lack of knowledge about current configurations and the underlying dependencies. It is also essential for a variety of management output, including incident management. Incident management tasks include change management and other tasks that call for profound awareness of the entire IT configuration.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Automated Incident Management <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f468-200d-1f4bb.png" alt="👨‍💻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>



<p>The projects that leverage AIOps insights to support <strong>the automatic remediation of problems brought on by both existing incidents and anticipated problems</strong> are established by organizations looking to get the most out of AIOps.</p>



<p>Since they make use of AI&#8217;s analytics and learning models, these kinds of capabilities are quite alluring for AIOps. They finally deliver on automation which has hovered over IT operations for years. </p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Read our blog to learn more about other <a href="https://acure.io/blog/it-operations">IT operations advantages</a>.  </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why is AIOps Going to Become the Future of IT Operations?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Reduction in Volumes of Noise </h3>



<p>An IT operations team may get overburdened by the volume of services, resources, and alerts which may result from a single incident. Vast quantities of additional information are difficult for old IT management methods to keep up with. <strong>Key signals are sometimes unable to be distinguished from noise and get lost within them</strong>. This amount of noise may lead to prolonged slowdowns and diminished user functioning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Workflow automation can be increased with the help of AIOps tools. Teams dealing with IT operations can benefit from this process of <strong>detecting and analyzing problems and difficulties to improve security, develop a foolproof plan, or perform an automated patch by examining tools and data.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>AIOps products can connect and separate events to produce meaningful and valuable insights, pinpoint and detect the problem&#8217;s location and offer automated solutions for quicker problem-solving.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Transparency Across Systems</h3>



<p>Having access to data related to operations enables teams deployed for <strong>IT operations to see issues even before they arise</strong>. By using real-time detection methods, businesses may become proactive in the way they solve problems and act faster and more efficiently. Enterprises must have this detection accuracy and must gain complete insights into operations data.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="400" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Acure-AIOps-Meme.jpg" alt="Acure AIOps Meme" class="wp-image-3672" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Acure-AIOps-Meme.jpg 750w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Acure-AIOps-Meme-500x267.jpg 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Acure-AIOps-Meme-320x171.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Acure AIOps Meme</figcaption></figure>



<p>These insights can be made available to Enterprises via AIOps big data platforms. <strong>An AIOps platform can be used by IT managers to obtain more in-depth analytics about the lifespan of an application.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Strengthening Security</h3>



<p>By integrating Artificial Intelligence into security systems, <strong>systems can detect data theft and violations</strong>. By gathering and combining internal logs, such as software and application data, networking records, and malicious sources, we may <strong>use AIOps algorithms to detect dangerous and suspicious behaviors</strong>. Businesses can also utilize the technology to find potential hazards hiding in their networks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/38-1024x576.png" alt="Security pic" class="wp-image-4229" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/38-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/38-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/38-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/38-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/38-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/38-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/38-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/38.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Security is one of the most significant specialized cases of anomaly detection. Strengthening the security of the IT infrastructure is one of AIOps&#8217; features.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Boost Customer Experience </h3>



<p>IT incidents that might affect the user experience must be addressed immediately and managed effectively. Many times, AIOps can foresee future occurrences and stop them from happening with the aid of automation and actionable insights. <strong>AIOps advises using knowledge base articles for self-service resolutions so they don&#8217;t have to wait for IT professionals, which will reduce resolution time.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/36-1024x576.png" alt="Customer experience pic " class="wp-image-4231" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/36-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/36-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/36-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/36-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/36-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/36-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/36-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/36.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The rate of technological changes has made IT an ongoing business collaborator, and expectations have automatically grown for IT to provide experiences comparable to those of other technologically advanced sectors.<strong> AIOps can assist in resolving unanticipated occurrences swiftly, even if they do happen. </strong><strong>The result is a better user experience.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. A Boon for Businesses</h3>



<p>AIOps anticipates resource usage and productivity problems. By using probable cause analysis, it concentrates on the most probable cause of an issue. Using grouping and detection techniques, it is possible to pinpoint the underlying issues that are responsible for events.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>AIOps aid in maximizing your team&#8217;s overall capacity while lowering costs and increasing output</strong>. Your desk team&#8217;s workload can be reduced by using Artificial Intelligence and automation to analyze the usage patterns, user interaction data, and support ticket patterns.</p>
