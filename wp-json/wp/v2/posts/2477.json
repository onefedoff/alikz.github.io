Knowledge of a Wide Range of DevOps Technologies<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>DevOps is a relatively young concept, having emerged in the late 2000s as a trend. As a result, emerging innovations continue to emerge in the DevOps ecosystem. Therefore it is important to consider whether a DevOps candidate is familiar with a variety of DevOps techniques when hiring DevOps engineers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Security<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>DevOps is all about speed, automation, and reliability. That&#8217;s where the secure DevSecOps practice takes shape and vulnerabilities follow increased coding speed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Engineers must be able to write code that is resistant to a variety of assaults and weaknesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Expertise With Major DevOps Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A competent DevOps engineer must understand how to use a number of DevOps tools effectively in addition to knowing the latest DevOps technology. Determining what tool to use, when, and how to use it, is a vital skill in DevOps because it comprises multiple phases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the common DevOps tools list that a DevOps engineer must know:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.datadoghq.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>DataDog<\/strong><\/a><strong>:<\/strong> Datadog is a significant cloud application tracking and protection platform. Its features assist businesses in securing their systems, avoiding downtime, and ensuring the best possible user experience for their consumers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.splunk.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Moogsoft<\/a><\/strong>: Moogsoft helps in the detection and repair of an outage that is hampered by large amounts of data. Its enrichment provides actionable insights by adding context to received alerts from multiple data sources.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.splunk.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Splunk<\/a><\/strong>: Splunk&#8217;s data platform is expandable, allowing for unified protection, full-stack observability, and endless bespoke solutions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/resolve.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Resolve.io<\/a><\/strong>: Resolve.io provides your IT teams with sophisticated automation that is purpose-built for them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/\">Acure<\/a><\/strong>: A topology-based AIOPs platform with a full<strong> functionality CMDB<\/strong> that you can use<strong> for free<\/strong>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pagerduty.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">PageDuty<\/a><\/strong>: PagerDuty is used for more efficient digital operations,&nbsp; a faster resolution of issues, and for keeping your business running at all times<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/sciencelogic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ScienceLogic<\/a><\/strong>: Science Logic uses data-driven automation to assist IT operations professionals in delivering better business results.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/DevOps-Meme-Acure.io_.jpg\" alt=\"DevOps Meme\" class=\"wp-image-3573\" srcset=\"https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/DevOps-Meme-Acure.io_.jpg 750w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/DevOps-Meme-Acure.io_-500x267.jpg 500w, https:\/\/acure.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/DevOps-Meme-Acure.io_-320x171.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">DevOps Meme<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Flexibility<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The DevOps engineer must have an extensive understanding of the ever-changing technology as well as the ability to work with the most up-to-date tools and stacks. They must also be capable of integrating, testing, releasing, and deploying each project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. &nbsp;Active Collaboration<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yes, we know you must hate it \ud83d\ude05<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is one of the necessary skills for a good DevOps Engineer. To optimize the workflow coming in from the cross-functional ecosystem of programmers, developers, and business units, active communication is required. Transparency and open communication amongst engineers is essential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Automation Expertise<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To be referred to as a good DevOps engineer, you must have a strong understanding of automation, which is at the heart of the DevOps process. A DevOps engineer should be able to automate the full DevOps pipeline, which includes CI\/CD cycles, application data monitoring, performance and configurations, and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Scripting and Coding<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Two critical skills for a DevOps engineer to have been coding and scripting. Python, Django, Java, Javascript, Bash, PHP, and Node are all examples of programming languages that are commonly used by DevOps engineers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Cloud Expertise<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud and DevOps are inextricably linked. The effectiveness of one is directly influenced by the effectiveness of the other. While the DevOps technique accelerates a development process, the cloud facilitates it by providing the essential infrastructure for testing, deploying, and launching code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Customer Centric<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>DevOps engineers must be able to imagine themselves in the shoes of their customers and make judgments based on their needs. This will help them collaborate with developers, stakeholders, and others that are part of the development team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Proactiveness<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ha-ha-ha \ud83d\ude05<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, DevOps engineers and professionals will need to be proactive and enthusiastic about their work, which will reflect in their performance and productivity. Furthermore, maintaining current with pertinent technology, new tools, and other factors is an important element of your approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">11. Fundamentals of Linux Should Be Well-Understood<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>DevOps engineers must have solid <a href=\"https:\/\/opensource.com\/business\/15\/2\/how-linux-philosophy-affects-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Linux principles<\/a> understanding because most firms&#8217; tech infrastructures run on Linux, and configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, and Puppet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">12. Infrastructure as Code<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Infrastructure as Code, also known as programmable infrastructure, is a type of IT infrastructure that enables operations teams to collaborate and provision resources using code rather than a manual procedure.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing infrastructure is a must-have ability to look for when recruiting DevOps engineers since it allows them to efficiently create and deploy apps on the best platform available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">13. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery\u2019s Understanding<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not enough for a DevOps engineer to know how to use specific tools. Recruiters should look for someone who understands how to use it. Knowing where to use these tools will make Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery much easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">14. Soft Skills<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If an engineer is strong at code and automation, it won&#8217;t cut it. DevOps requires a different kind of person, one with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/s\/soft-skills.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">soft skills<\/a>, self-motivation, adaptability, and a willingness to learn. Professionals in DevOps should be both doers and listeners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">15. Version Control and Configuration<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Jenkins, a continuous integration tool, had been around for a long time before DevOps became so popular. With the support of its automated capability, this technology helped the operations team achieve great success by enabling a consistent build. Therefore, a DevOps engineer must know how to automate code-building processes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A fantastic bonus video:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Autonomous IT Talks w\/ Savinder Puri, DevOps Evangelist at TBC\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/WIC9iCynl-Q?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is the DevOps Engineer Salary in Different Countries?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The table below shows the minimal and maximum salaries that can be expected in various countries for a DevOps engineer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Country<\/td><td><strong>Minimum Salary P\/A<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Maximum Salary P\/A<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>U.S.A<\/td><td>$ 63,000<\/td><td>$ 134,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>U.K<\/td><td>\u20ac 26,000<\/td><td>\u20ac 67,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>India<\/td><td>INR 3,07,000<\/td><td>\u20b9 2,000,000&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Canada<\/td><td>CAD 55,000<\/td><td><em>C<\/em>$ 99,000<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is AWS DevOps Certification?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AWS DevOps certification assists organizations in identifying and training people with crucial capabilities for cloud implementation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The capability to automate the testing and installation of AWS infrastructure and apps is validated by becoming an AWS Certified DevOps Engineer.
