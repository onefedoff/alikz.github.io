<p>Do you want to begin a career in IT but don&#8217;t feel interested in traditional positions like software development? Do you pay close attention to details and enjoy solving minute problems? Finding a career as a site reliability engineer, or SRE, might be the answer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?cmp=RIOS-Intelligent-Machines&amp;t=Site+Reliability+Engineer&amp;jk=3b73ffa575fe9580&amp;q=%22site+Reliability+Engineer%22&amp;vjs=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Site reliability managers</a> primarily focus on automating easy tasks within a system, enhancing system functionality/reducing error, and detecting/fixing problems. The job of an effective SRE is to ensure that systems function as smoothly as possible, eliminating extra work for IT teams and reducing the likelihood of system collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you would like to learn more about becoming an SRE, the professionals at Acure have put together the following guide on SREs. We will break down the characteristics of an ideal SRE candidate, the general requirements for the job, and day-to-day SRE practices. Keep reading to find out more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who Is SRE?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-1024x576.png" alt="SRE picture" class="wp-image-5564" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/132.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the past, software development teams created programs without the help of IT teams. After the software teams successfully designed their systems, they pass their work onto an IT team. This IT team would then be responsible&nbsp;for&nbsp;fixing errors, taking calls, and maintaining and deploying the program.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=2cd47692d82bfb8b&amp;tk=1gmdvo10eln1c801&amp;from=serp&amp;vjs=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">site reliability engineer</a>&nbsp;is a position that Google created to streamline IT processes. This position is the bridge between IT operators and software developers, capitalizing upon the practices of DevOps. Where DevOps primarily focuses on ensuring that operation and developer teams work together to create reliable systems and develop products, SREs work to enhance system reliability and resilience.</p>



<p>SREs primarily monitor the following aspects of a system:</p>



<ul>
<li>Website Traffic</li>



<li>System Errors</li>



<li>Saturation/Capacity</li>



<li>System Latency</li>



<li>System Automation</li>



<li>Incident Response</li>
</ul>



<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f449.png" alt="üëâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Read more about SRE principles and its benefits for organizations in <a href="https://acure.io/blog/sre/">our previous article</a>.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Career and Salary <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4b0.png" alt="üí∞" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>The average salary of an SRE in the United States is around $100,000 a year. It is also common for SREs to earn bonuses that amount to a little over $20,000 extra a year. The more experience you gain as an SRE, the more money you will make.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Employers are more likely to hire candidates with a degree in computer science, though sufficient certifications and previous background in IT can guarantee you a position in a company. Some companies will allow you to work remotely, while others may require that you come into the office. Popular companies for SREs include Target, Twitter, Adobe, Wayfair, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Role and Responsibilities</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="968" height="528" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SRE-meme-1.png" alt="SRE meme" class="wp-image-5549" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SRE-meme-1.png 968w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SRE-meme-1-500x273.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SRE-meme-1-320x175.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SRE-meme-1-768x419.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 968px) 100vw, 968px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SRE meme</figcaption></figure>



<p>The primary responsibilities of an SRE (or SRE teams) include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixing issues with a program/system</li>



<li>Quickly responding to client problems</li>



<li>Creating software to streamline processes for IT workers</li>



<li>Managing on-call responsibilities</li>



<li>Documenting their knowledge of systems and common errors</li>



<li>Automating&nbsp;system administration</li>



<li>Analyzing&nbsp;past problems to prevent future errors</li>
</ul>



<p>SREs&nbsp;constantly look for new ways to improve systems and reduce common errors or incidents. If such a malfunction occurs, an SRE must address the error quickly. Then, the SRE ought to reflect on how they can prevent such an error from occurring in the future by enhancing the reliability of that system.</p>



<p>Many site reliability engineers use AI programs to streamline their job.&nbsp;<a href="https://acure.io/landing/get-started-with-aiops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Such programs</a>&nbsp;sort through system issues to determine which alerts are important. These AI programs enhance the reliability of an SRE by ensuring that their IT services perform well without wasting time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Skills, Courses, and Certification <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f393.png" alt="üéì" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>People who are most suitable for a career in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=584b42f23ad9f46d&amp;tk=1gmdvo10eln1c801&amp;from=serp&amp;vjs=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">system reliability engineering</a>&nbsp;must:</p>



<ul>
<li>Be quick on their feet</li>



<li>Easily understand the basics of a system even if they have not seen it before</li>



<li>Enjoy building complex software and systems</li>



<li>Possess curiosity and a love for learning</li>



<li>Stay calm despite feeling pressured</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond these characteristics, SREs must have some background in IT or software development. However, ideal candidates do not come from a specific discipline in IT. Anyone from a biochemist to a self-taught candidate for sysadmin can find success in a career as an SRE.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Suggested Courses and Skills for SREs</h3>



<p>Having a background and/or certification in certain programs and coding is helpful when applying for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=5ecfd44e5e629928&amp;tk=1gmdvo10eln1c801&amp;from=serp&amp;vjs=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">site reliability engineer</a>&nbsp;jobs. You should learn how to program shell scripts as well as understand programming languages such as C, Rust, Go, Python, and Java.</p>



<p>We also suggest that you learn how to create websites. To do so, either take a course or use cloud servers such as Amazon Web Services or Digital Ocean on your own time. Creating your website by coding your own HTML or using old-school programming methods such as PHP and MySQL can also help you become a better SRE.</p>



<p>Learning about automation through a continuous integration pipeline like Jenkins or Travis CI is also helpful. Furthermore, you should also know some basic code editing skills. Use programs such as Atom or Eclipse for coding practice.</p>



<p>You must also have a basic understanding of NoSQL databases and data models. Understanding Linux and service-oriented architecture (SOA) is also quite helpful. We also recommend you understand monitoring tools and software systems (such as Acure).</p>



<p>Though not all of these skills are necessary to become an SRE, they will help you succeed in your career.</p>

<p>IT failures happen, and analyzing their impact delivers greater insight into the company‚Äôs performance. Additionally, understanding what business impact analysis in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/it-infrastructure-library#:~:text=ITIL%20stands%20for%20Information%20Technology,and%20printed%20them%20for%20distribution." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ITIL</a> is can help you understand how resilient your IT infrastructure is and where to make improvements.</p>



<p>Because IT infrastructures encompasses software, hardware, and human power, they interact at varying levels. With business impact analysis, you can understand each of those levels, understand the health of your system, and plan for business continuity if part of the system goes down.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is Business Impact Analysis in ITIL?</h2>



<p>Business impact analysis in the IT Infrastructure Library demonstrates how IT systems integrate within a business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With many dynamic components in an IT infrastructure, it can be tricky to understand the entire system and how each subsystem impacts business operations and application and server performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Business impact analysis gives a clear picture of the IT infrastructure, its topography, and its weaknesses to show where the company needs improvements.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-44-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5436" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-44-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-44-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-44-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-44-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-44-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-44-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-44-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pics-for-Acure-Blog-44.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Is IT Business Impact Analysis Important for Your Business?</h2>



<p>Businesses always face risk, and the main purpose of business impact analysis for IT infrastructure is risk management. Understanding risks and potential bottlenecks in the IT system allows companies to evaluate, minimize, and eliminate threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Addressing specific potential risks helps businesses take action ahead of time to mitigate risks should circumstances affect performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using business impact analysis for IT infrastructure with dynamic components, you will understand the following about your company:</p>



<ul>
<li>How to avoid system outages and what initiatives are in place to prevent them</li>



<li>The maximum amount of downtime allowed for critical systems</li>



<li>The most important IT systems and processes critical to business operations and performance</li>



<li>The recovery order of critical IT systems and processes if a failure occurs</li>
</ul>



<p>When tackling the complexity of analysis, it‚Äôs best to start at micro levels, with small implementations and examinations. By understanding small, individual failures or successes, you will notice interdependencies and how they affect your overall infrastructure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Examples of Business Impact Analysis for IT</h2>



<p>An example of business impact analysis for IT infrastructure is examining storage as a service. With most businesses relying heavily on the cloud, storage is essential for business functions such as email, file systems, document creation, communication services, enterprise resource planning, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a company‚Äôs cloud storage service, with servers located in one region, experiences failure, divisions worldwide may face downtime, disruptions, or other impacts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some measurement examples of business impact analysis for IT infrastructure include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Creating a system to determine an activity‚Äôs impact on operations</li>



<li>Categorizing IT systems and processes by profitability</li>



<li>Ranking IT systems and processes by how necessary their recovery is to operations; critical, vital, important, non-essential, etc.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Analysis to determine how combinations of failures can factor into operations</li>
</ul>



<p>Through this business impact analysis, a company can devise a plan for restoring business operations if its cloud storage fails.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Acure Can Help with Business Impact Analysis for IT Infrastructure</h2>



<p><a href="https://acure.io/use-cases/root-cause-impact-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Impact analysis in Acure</a> helps you understand how much the problem affects the business and which incident takes priority.</p>



<p>After collecting the data and correlation setup, you can see the status of the entire IT infrastructure and information about all incidents on a single screen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Service-Model-window-edited-1024x639.png" alt="Business Impact Analysis in Acure.io" class="wp-image-4807" width="610" height="381" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Service-Model-window-edited-1024x639.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Service-Model-window-edited-500x312.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Service-Model-window-edited-320x200.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Service-Model-window-edited-768x480.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Service-Model-window-edited.png 1081w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Topology graph in Acure.io</figcaption></figure>



<p>Topology shows the whole IT infrastructure like a tree with the relationships between configuration items. You can click on an affected CI to see the health, weight and dependecies and easily identify the source of the problem using the connections on the graph. Then, via log analyzing, you can easily identify the impact of the problem on a particular service.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is IT Ops?</h2>



<p>IT stands for information technology, which describes the use of hardware and software to create, store, process, and obtain data across a network. In today&#8217;s tech-focused world, every organization has an internal information technology department that handles its computer system and all of the related equipment. An IT operations manager oversees the management of technological communication and the hardware and software associated with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When building a career in IT operations management, these are the six skills that you should master.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/111-1024x576.png" alt="IT operations manager skills picture" class="wp-image-5361" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/111-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/111-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/111-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/111-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/111-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/111-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/111-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/111.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. ITIL</h3>



<p>You need to master ITIL as this is the industry standard for IT technology operations management jobs. The ITIL principles and processes govern every aspect of IT and define the protocol for IT within an organization. Mastering ITIL will put you ahead of the game when it comes to the IT operations manager career path.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Project Management</h3>



<p>IT managers must have strong project management skills to be efficient. This encompasses managing the scope of various internal and external projects related to the IT department. From handling timelines to overseeing budgets and negotiating with software vendors, project management is one of the less technical skills that a good IT operations manager will need to master.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. A Strong Knowledge of the Cloud</h3>



<p>An IT operations manager must have a strong understanding of the cloud and should know how to manage all aspects of cloud services. A strong skill set in cloud computing will ensure the efficient handling of software and the effective training of staff members. IT operations managers oversee everything cloud-related, from planning the migration of files to designing and implementing cloud-based IT solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Acure</h3>



<p>IT Ops managers can&#8217;t manually oversee every component of the IT infrastructure. A working knowledge of the most popular monitoring software is crucial as an IT Ops manager. Acure is a popular software tool that IT operations managers use to facilitate automated actions and root cause analysis. Acure is a powerful tool for effective process management, automation, and preparing for and responding to downtime.</p>



<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="üí°" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong> <strong>Read more about features of the last Acure update <a href="https://acure.io/blog/metrics-acure-2-2/">in our blog</a>.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Excellent Strategizing</h3>



<p>An IT manager will need to have strategic thinking and a careful approach. Often they are in charge of setting up an entire technology infrastructure, including all of the computer systems. They will need to be able to plan out the software and hardware, deploy software updates throughout the organization, and design scalable processes. One key aspect of IT management is developing a strategy for anticipating the future technology needs of a business.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Communication</h3>



<p>Whether you are manning the service desk and assisting employees with IT issues or designing a plan to migrate data to the cloud, you&#8217;ll be working with people. Good communication skills are a must as an IT ops manager.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Educational Requirements to Become an IT Ops Manager <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f393.png" alt="üéì" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>According to statistics, roughly 63% of operations managers have a bachelor&#8217;s degree, and 13% have a master&#8217;s degree. However, the position focuses more on experience than on educational qualifications. It is possible to become an IT ops manager without attending college.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/108-1024x576.png" alt="IT operations manager education picture" class="wp-image-5360" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/108-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/108-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/108-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/108-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/108-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/108-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/108-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/108.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">ITIL Certification</h3>



<p>Obtaining an ITIL certificate is a key aspect of the IT ops career path. This certificate will help you earn more and improve your chances of advancing to IT operations manager.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bachelor&#8217;s Degree</h3>



<p>While a bachelor&#8217;s degree is not a firm requirement to succeed in the tech industry, it does put you a step ahead of the competition. The most typical majors for IT operations managers are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Computer science</li>



<li>Business</li>



<li>Information technology</li>
</ul>



<p>Getting a bachelor&#8217;s degree in technology management is also helpful in the career path to becoming an IT operations manager. This degree will help you get jobs in database development, analysis, programming, and other entry-level IT roles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you have the necessary experience and education, you can move up to a more advanced position as a supervisor or manager. Ultimately the career path can go as far as a Chief Technology Officer or IT Director.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Master&#8217;s Degree</h3>



<p>Obtaining a master&#8217;s degree will prove beneficial if your goal is to rise to more advanced roles in the IT division, such as management. Many employers will want to know that you have invested time in becoming educated in the field. However, if you have many years of experience in IT, you won&#8217;t need a master&#8217;s degree to get a position as an IT operations manager.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you choose to pursue a master&#8217;s degree, select a course of study that highlights technical, strategic, and management-focused skills.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">About DevOps dimensions</h2>



<p>&#8220;It is famously said that every company is a software company. And I would like to extend by saying that today in 2022, every company is a DevOps company. Especially in the post-pandemic world, that has become the norm. DevOps is no longer a word you just hear in conferences. It has become a glaring business&nbsp;requirement today.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-cover-1024x576.png" alt="Savider Puri" class="wp-image-4448" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-cover-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-cover-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-cover-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-cover-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-cover-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-cover-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-cover-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-cover.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>There are a couple of dimensions in DevOps that make it increasingly important. First is <strong>the business impact</strong> &#8211; the direct impact on the top line that an organization can check with metrics. </p>



<p>Then, there‚Äôs the <strong>bottom-line impact</strong>, with things like developer productivity, defect density, and cost of quality. So that&#8217;s the business angle to it. The organizational angle is that all organizations are now moving, or maturing towards agile, guilds, chapter, tribe &#8211; whatever you call it. They&#8217;re either creating centralized structures, or they&#8217;re getting into the decentralized Center of Excellence (CoE) kind of teams, looking at creating Platform teams that need a DevOps approach. </p>



<p>Then <strong>the ways of working are changing</strong>. That&#8217;s the third dimension to it. The <strong>feature driven development</strong>, talks about continuous security, and <strong>canary deployments</strong> &#8211; all that needs DevOps. </p>



<p>And then finally, <strong>new technologies coming </strong>in like chaos engineering, AB testing, Metaverse, etc. There&#8217;s a lot of talk about carbon emissions in software industry too. In fact, I&#8217;m one of the mentors at DevOps Summit, Canada, where this is a new track that we are picking up &#8211; how do you reduce carbon emissions in the software development lifecycle, and that&#8217;s where again, DevOps has a role. So DevOps has become very important in any dimension that you look at, in the entire software delivery lifecycle&#8221;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">About Different DevOps Transformation</h2>

<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, the focus of DevOps is different for small and medium enterprises than the&nbsp;largeer enterprises. And that‚Äôs because&nbsp; business requirements are different. And there are two-three angles to this. </p>



<p>One is the <strong>operations angle</strong>. Typically, a small enterprise is focused on stabilizing and scaling up operations without impacting user experience. I was reading an article, and there was a cricket match between India and Pakistan over the weekend. That&#8217;s the Asia Cup final. One of the popular channels Disney Hotstar was telecasting it to 13 million concurrent users. Now, imagine the amount of infrastructure you need to be able to support! And this is across mobile devices. The majority of them were watching it on cell phones, on the go at 3g, 4g, 5g speeds. So imagine the kind of infrastructure it will take to support something like that. Yes, that&#8217;s at the small and the medium businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then you come to the banks, the large retailers, where they have a different problem. There, you have <strong>a wealth of technology</strong>. You know, everything from the Java, .NET, multiple ERPs, Oracle, Salesforce, Mainframe, Heritage Systems, and you have to support all of that. It&#8217;s a fundamental difference in their structure. There&#8217;s a big people dimension as well. People want to work in an organization which supports 13 million concurrent users, which is telecasting the next big sporting event. People probably don&#8217;t want to work in a bank, which has been around for 100 years, and&nbsp;is not transforming. It&#8217;s about attracting the right talent also. So <strong>we have different organizations, different dimensions to the challenge, both from a technology and a people perspective&#8221;.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">About DevOps Career Path&nbsp;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DevOps-career-path-picture-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4462" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DevOps-career-path-picture-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DevOps-career-path-picture-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DevOps-career-path-picture-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DevOps-career-path-picture-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DevOps-career-path-picture-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DevOps-career-path-picture-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DevOps-career-path-picture-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DevOps-career-path-picture.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>&#8220;A typical DevOps engineer profile could be different for different organizations because this is still not very well established. This is how a typical DevOps engineer&#8217;s career will move and this is how I&#8217;ve seen it evolve in the last 10-15 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You start with a <strong>DevOps engineer</strong>, basically maintaining a DevOps pipeline, you&#8217;re fixing build breaks, you&#8217;re doing continuous automation, you&#8217;re putting the fundamentals in place, you&#8217;re gaining the depth of skill, because you&#8217;re in one team on one technology stack, and you&#8217;re going deep. That&#8217;s a typical DevOps engineers‚Äô profile.</p>



<p>A couple of years later, you move to a <strong>senior DevOps engineer</strong>, where you&#8217;re graduating from maintaining somebody else&#8217;s pipeline to creating a pipeline and onboarding new projects into the DevOps pipeline. You&#8217;re continuously automating on the environment side, on the app side. Now, you&#8217;ve gone from one team to multiple teams. You gain a width of skills, and then you start cementing the fundamentals that you&#8217;ve probably learned in the first couple of years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then you grow on to a <strong>DevOps architect</strong>, where you work across multiple technology stacks, hopefully, across an enterprise.&nbsp;You can set up a DevOps capability. You‚Äôre&nbsp;training the development teams. Here you have width and depth of technology. It‚Äôs very important at this stage to start developing people skills in parallel because as you move further on from a DevOps architect, you will have a lot more people interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-Devops-Career-1024x576.png" alt="DevOps career path from video" class="wp-image-4435" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-Devops-Career-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-Devops-Career-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-Devops-Career-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-Devops-Career-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-Devops-Career-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-Devops-Career-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-Devops-Career-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Savinder-Puri-Devops-Career.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Now, there&#8217;s a fork in the road. What does that mean? You can go in a technology direction, <strong>the principal architect</strong>, who typically pushes for DevOps at a large enterprise. You are at the bleeding edge of new technology, stacks, new tools, you work across cross-functional teams, and you&#8217;re trying to break the silo between the Dev and the Ops, but you&#8217;re basically a <strong>DevOps architect with a very strong technology vision.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The other alternative to this is more technology focused very deep technical work. The other side to that is <strong>consulting</strong>, where you go more on the web part of it, you probably work in an SI or a consulting company. You work across Enterprises, drive business value, and you may be set up DevOps capability for large enterprises. You talk about organizational change management, <strong>this is an architect with a business vision.&nbsp;</strong>Now, you can&#8217;t directly become <strong>a DevOps consultant</strong>, if you&#8217;ve not done the pipelines and everything in between by yourself.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>And then you evolve into a <strong>DevOps evangelist</strong>. Evangelists are typically one who has worked across multiple enterprises who have done various shapes and forms of organizational change management, and who&#8217;s created new roles and responsibilities in the organization. We spoke about probably setting up an SRE function, a release management function and those kinds of things. And this is who has enterprise structure for multispeed IT where some parts of the organization are moving extremely fast. They are into microservices, cloud native, and the other side of the organization. So that&#8217;s the typical career path of a DevOps engineer&#8221;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">About The Future Of System Administrators</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sysadmin-picture-1024x576.png" alt="The Future of SysAdmins picture
" class="wp-image-4463" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sysadmin-picture-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sysadmin-picture-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sysadmin-picture-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sysadmin-picture-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sysadmin-picture-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sysadmin-picture-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sysadmin-picture-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sysadmin-picture.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>&#8220;Today‚Äôs typical Enterprises are all moving towards using some parts&nbsp; of the Cloud, probably they will even go serverless in some portions, and move their data into the cloud over the next four or five years. Now let&#8217;s look at what happens to system admins, as this change happens. Their bread and butter &#8211;&nbsp; supporting Environments, IIS, WebLogic,&nbsp;WebSphere, etc. will disappear in the next five years. Most technologies will not be relevant because the way you deploy a cloud native application and application over a container is completely different than this. It may be around <strong>20-30% of the infrastructure will still be heritage</strong>. Maybe some in a bank or in the retailers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They&#8217;re also the way they are creating environments. Today, maybe it&nbsp;takes a week or ten days to create environments. We&#8217;re talking about immutable environments, creating environments in matter of hours, if not minutes, the way they do patching, the way they do release management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you look at the latest <strong>Upskilling industry report from DevOps Institute</strong>, that covered about 120 odd countries, they also say that <strong>40% of the people said that resource and skill shortage is one of the top three challenges</strong>. And technical debt must be paired with talent debt. So the opportunity is out there for the system admins to evolve themselves into the new roles. The business requirement is there, the opportunity is there. Now it is upon the individuals, whether they want to <strong>jump on that bandwagon and move into the new workload of 60-70%</strong>. Or they want to <strong>stay at the guard of</strong> <strong>20-30%</strong>, which will continue for a couple of years further. But then life is tough.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to create a very bleak picture out there. But as you can understand large transformation programs like this don&#8217;t happen in one or two years. They take time depends on your organization and what phase of the transformation program it is in. But one thing very clear the wave is coming, and <strong>it will fundamentally change the way we have worked in the last 15-20 years</strong>. But there is no need to panic. As long as you recognize that the world out there is changing you have time to make the right moves, learn the right things, pick up the new roles&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">About SRE as a Option for Career</h2>



<p>&#8220;Things like SRE were carved out primarily by the likes of Google. They operate in a very different space, they had a different set of challenges. And they came out with the concept of SRE, which works great in their context. Just renaming your support team on a random Monday morning and calling it an SRE team won&#8217;t really work. It&#8217;s a good career pivot, if your organization has people who can think through the&nbsp;journey, and tailor what SRE needs for your enterprise. Because your enterprise is not&nbsp;Google, and it doesn&#8217;t have the same challenges. So, if that is done it&#8217;s a good logical extension for people in the traditional app area assuming, that they are willing to pick up some new skills and change the way in which they have been working&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">About Other IT Roles and Steps for People Looking for Guidance</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Other-IT-roles-picture-1024x576.png" alt="Other IT roles picture" class="wp-image-4464" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Other-IT-roles-picture-1024x576.png 1024w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Other-IT-roles-picture-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Other-IT-roles-picture-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Other-IT-roles-picture-768x432.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Other-IT-roles-picture-1536x864.png 1536w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Other-IT-roles-picture-1200x675.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Other-IT-roles-picture-1568x882.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Other-IT-roles-picture.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re working in a large enterprise in things like <strong>ITIL</strong>, for example, or any other shape and form of, if you&#8217;ve led a lean initiative, then the new versions of ITIL like ITIL V4 could be easy to pick on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you pick up <strong>infrastructure automation</strong>, good opportunity will be to go into infrastructure as cloud, looking at things like <strong>Chef, Puppet Ansible, TerraForm</strong>. And you can very heavily relate that to the way you used to create environments in the past. All you need to figure out is your area environment. How does that map to container? What&#8217;s the difference? And how do you map your traditional world of a virtual environment and virtual systems and how does that relate to containers? If you can make that shift that&#8217;s another good area to get into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then there is the <strong>DevOps engineer area</strong>. If you&#8217;re excited about creating software builds, shipping out stuff faster to customers, that&#8217;s potentially another area you can look at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of my mentors told me several years back: always pray true to your core skill. If core skill is system admin stay true to it, you just have to see how it maps in the new world. If your true skill is an infrastructure engineer stay true to that, because you spend ten or twenty years doing that. So don&#8217;t just jump and you know, start learning Kubernetes; it&#8217;s great, but probably is not relevant to us. <strong>Stay true to your core skill, figure out what&#8217;s the extension of your core skill in the new environment and then the gap how to bridge that. </strong>That is my three step algorithm for people who are looking for guidance&#8221;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">About Knowledge, Skills and Mastery</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="880" height="1024" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Acure-DevOps-map-1-880x1024.png" alt="DevOps Roadmap" class="wp-image-4489" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Acure-DevOps-map-1-880x1024.png 880w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Acure-DevOps-map-1-430x500.png 430w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Acure-DevOps-map-1-275x320.png 275w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Acure-DevOps-map-1-768x894.png 768w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Acure-DevOps-map-1-1320x1536.png 1320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Acure-DevOps-map-1-1200x1397.png 1200w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Acure-DevOps-map-1-1568x1825.png 1568w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Acure-DevOps-map-1.png 1758w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">DevOps Roadmap</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;You should always remember about the difference between <strong>knowledge, skill and mastery</strong>. What do I mean by that? You can at best master one or two areas in your entire life. Where you can be really, really, really good at it, you are the guru in that it&#8217;s just one or two areas.&nbsp;So that&#8217;s <strong>mastery</strong>. You can obviously have a number of <strong>skills</strong>.&nbsp;And you should have <strong>a knowledge</strong> of everything under the sun today. But the key is knowing what to master, what to get skilled on, and what to have knowledge of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you go to a conference, and they say serverless is the next big thing since sliced bread, you don&#8217;t go after the mastery of serverless. First, you want the knowledge of serverless. What is it? How is it relevant? Does it relate to what you‚Äôre doing or not? </p>



<p><strong>The very simple guideline for that is just type the new technology named serverless on Google, if you can answer the first page, and if you can understand what&#8217;s written on the first page, that&#8217;s good enough knowledge to get by simple rule.</strong></p>



<p>If that is something that relates to you, it&#8217;s interesting for you try and develop a skill around that. Go to Udemy, one of those online courses, pick up a course or two, probably use YouTube. Try a small proof of concept. It&#8217;s not about doing one course or two. It&#8217;s about building applications. Get a cloud account, download the tools, try something, build something. And then you will realize if you like it or not. And then go deeper. But stay with these three things: knowledge, skill, and mastery. Figure out which one to apply and where&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>The latency result</strong> is the same as the output of the cmd ping test. Small latency, or <strong>low ping</strong>, is crucial for more than just online gaming. Significant latency lowers the effectiveness of <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/voice-over-internet-protocol-voip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VoIP</a> (Voice over IP) and video conversations (e.g. Skype).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Large pings have the potential to significantly impact how quickly websites and other internet services respond.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Evolution Of What Is Ping Exactly</h2>



<p><strong>Ping derives from a term used in sonar technology, which sends out sound pulses and then watches for the return of the echo.</strong></p>



<p>A Windows, Mac, or Linux computer can be used to deliver ping commands. It&#8217;s a useful tool that has been around since the beginning of the 1980s.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Working Of Ping</h2>



<p>On a computer network, the majority of operating systems come with a ping utility that functions similarly. You issue the ping command while also providing an IP address or URL.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your computer sends the device a&nbsp;several <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">packets</a> of data before waiting for a response. <strong>The ping tool notifies you if there was no response or displays the time it takes each packet to complete the round trip when it receives the response.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using CMD Ping To Test Network Connectivity <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f468-200d-1f4bb.png" alt="üë®‚Äçüíª" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Launch the Terminal or Command Prompt. You can use the command Ping on any operating system&#8217;s command line interface. On all systems, the Ping command behaves essentially the same.</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch the<strong> Command Prompt in Windows</strong>. In the Search field, click the Start button and type &#8220;cmd.&#8221; Users of Windows 8 can type &#8220;cmd&#8221; from the Start screen. To open the Command Prompt, press Enter.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="2">
<li>Launch the <strong>Terminal if you&#8217;re using Mac OS X</strong>. The Utility folder can be found in your Applications folder. Choose Terminal.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="3">
<li>Open a <strong>Telnet/Terminal window if you&#8217;re using Linux</strong>. The Accessories folder in your Applications directory is where you&#8217;ll most frequently find it.</li>
</ol>



<p>Here, we&#8217;ll use the Windows Command Prompt. Press <strong>Windows + R</strong> in Windows. Type <strong><em>&#8220;cmd&#8221;</em></strong> into the search box in the Run window, then press Enter.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="940" height="529" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image.png" alt="How to start Command Promt" class="wp-image-4295" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image.png 940w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-500x281.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-320x180.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></figure>



<p>Enter <strong><em>&#8220;ping&#8221;</em></strong> followed by the URL or IP address you want to ping at the prompt. The response we receive when pinging ww.google.com can be seen below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="940" height="491" src="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-1.png" alt="Cmd Test Ping URL" class="wp-image-4297" srcset="https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-1.png 940w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-1-500x261.png 500w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-1-320x167.png 320w, https://acure.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-1-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></figure>



<p>On the first line of the response, it lists the URL you are pinging, the IP address connected to it, and the size of the packets being transmitted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The responses from each individual packet are displayed throughout the following four lines, together with the time (in milliseconds) required for the answer and the packet&#8217;s time-to-live (TTL), or the length of time required before the packet is deleted.</p>



<p>You may find a summary at the bottom that displays the total number of packets sent and received as well as the minimum, maximum, and average response times.</p>



<p>If pinging the router on our local network using its IP address. You‚Äôll also get a normal response from it.</p>



<p>Additionally, the ping tool notifies you when the machines you are pinging do not respond.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ping Command Availability</h3>



<p>Operating systems Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP all support the ping command from the Command Prompt. Older Windows versions like Windows 98 and 95 also support it.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Advanced Startup Options and System Recovery Options repair/recovery menus in Command Prompt contain this command.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Common Addresses To Ping</h3>



<p>You can just check your internet connectivity when running your cmd ping test. To do this, you must confirm that the IP address you are pinging is operational.</p>



<p>Even though every address might occasionally experience an outage, here are some reliable options for you to ping:</p>



<p>Open DNS addresses <strong>208.67.222.222</strong>, <strong>208.67.220.220</strong>, <strong>1.0.0.1</strong> (Cloudflare), <strong>8.8.8.8</strong> and <strong>8.8.4.4</strong> (Google DNS)</p>



<p>When you ping these IP addresses to check for connectivity, if you don&#8217;t get a response, there is probably an issue on your end.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding Ping Results</h3>



<p>The number of nodes on the path between your machine and the server has a significant impact on the cmd ping test result. They are known as routers, and their job is to send packets from the source IP address to the target IP address. The router must process each packet, and this process takes time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the delay caused by the physical link between two routers raises the ping. As a result, when lengthy fiber cables are employed for intercontinental connections, there is a noticeable increase in latency.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cmd Ping Test Connectivity Errors</h3>



<ol>
<li>The Reachable Host at Destination Request has expired.</li>



<li>Ping Request Failed to Locate Host.</li>



<li>Request timed out</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Applications Of Cmd Test Ping</h3>



<ol>
<li>Examining network accessibility.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="2">
<li>Determining how many devices are situated between the device and the server.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="3">
<li>Being aware of the IP address of a specific URL.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="4">
<li>Identifying the source of the issue. Ping your router if you are having trouble accessing a website. If the cmd ping test is successful, the issue is with the server and is beyond your control.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="5">
<li>Relaying additional data, such as average round-trip distance and data loss.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">To Wrape It Up</h2>



<p>Pinging enables you to check whether your computer can connect to other hardware on the local network, such as a router. Your device&#8217;s ability to connect to the internet and other devices is also shown by Ping. If your computer can connect, knowing how long it takes to connect, will help you determine whether a network issue is occurring locally or if it originates from another location.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact that ping functions are mainly the same regardless of the operating system you use, is one of its strongest features. The command terminal you use and the command itself are the only things that differ.</p>
