It&#8217;s a useful tool that has been around since the beginning of the 1980s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Working Of Ping<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On a computer network, the majority of operating systems come with a ping utility that functions similarly. You issue the ping command while also providing an IP address or URL.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your computer sends the device a&nbsp;several <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/learning\/network-layer\/what-is-a-packet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">packets<\/a> of data before waiting for a response. <strong>The ping tool notifies you if there was no response or displays the time it takes each packet to complete the round trip when it receives the response.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Using CMD Ping To Test Network Connectivity \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Launch the Terminal or Command Prompt. You can use the command Ping on any operating system&#8217;s command line interface. On all systems, the Ping command behaves essentially the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Launch the<strong> Command Prompt in Windows<\/strong>. In the Search field, click the Start button and type &#8220;cmd.&#8221; Users of Windows 8 can type &#8220;cmd&#8221; from the Start screen.

The Accessories folder in your Applications directory is where you&#8217;ll most frequently find it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, we&#8217;ll use the Windows Command Prompt.

You\u2019ll also get a normal response from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the ping tool notifies you when the machines you are pinging do not respond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ping Command Availability<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Operating systems Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP all support the ping command from the Command Prompt. Older Windows versions like Windows 98 and 95 also support it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the Advanced Startup Options and System Recovery Options repair\/recovery menus in Command Prompt contain this command.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common Addresses To Ping<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can just check your internet connectivity when running your cmd ping test. To do this, you must confirm that the IP address you are pinging is operational.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though every address might occasionally experience an outage, here are some reliable options for you to ping:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open DNS addresses <strong>208.67.222.222<\/strong>, <strong>208.67.220.220<\/strong>, <strong>1.0.0.1<\/strong> (Cloudflare), <strong>8.8.8.8<\/strong> and <strong>8.8.4.4<\/strong> (Google DNS)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you ping these IP addresses to check for connectivity, if you don&#8217;t get a response, there is probably an issue on your end.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding Ping Results<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of nodes on the path between your machine and the server has a significant impact on the cmd ping test result. They are known as routers, and their job is to send packets from the source IP address to the target IP address. The router must process each packet, and this process takes time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the delay caused by the physical link between two routers raises the ping. As a result, when lengthy fiber cables are employed for intercontinental connections, there is a noticeable increase in latency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cmd Ping Test Connectivity Errors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Reachable Host at Destination Request has expired.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ping Request Failed to Locate Host.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Request timed out<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Applications Of Cmd Test Ping<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Examining network accessibility.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Determining how many devices are situated between the device and the server.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Being aware of the IP address of a specific URL.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Identifying the source of the issue.

Your device&#8217;s ability to connect to the internet and other devices is also shown by Ping. If your computer can connect, knowing how long it takes to connect, will help you determine whether a network issue is occurring locally or if it originates from another location.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that ping functions are mainly the same regardless of the operating system you use, is one of its strongest features. The command terminal you use and the command itself are the only things that differ.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The latency result is the same as the output of the cmd ping test.
